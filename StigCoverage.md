## MS Dot Net Framework, Version 1.8

**Title:** Microsoft DotNet Framework 4.0 STIG
**Version:** 1
**Release:** Release: 8 Benchmark Date: 16 July 2019
**FileName:** U_MS_DotNet_Framework_4-0_STIG_V1R8_Manual-xccdf.xml
**Created:** 8/14/2019
**Description:** Applicable to systems and applications utilizing the Microsoft .Net version 4.0 framework.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-30935 | RegistryRule | Registry | The "bypassTrustedAppStrongNames" setting specifies whether the bypass feature that avoids validating strong names for full-trust assemblies is enabled. By default the bypass feature is enabled in .Net 4, therefore strong names are not validated for correctness when the assembly/program is loaded. Not validating strong names provides a faster application load time but at the expense of performing certificate validation. Full trust assemblies are .Net applications launched from the local host. Strong names are digital signatures tied to .Net applications/assemblies. .Net 4 considers applications installed locally to be fully trusted by default and grants these applications full permissions to access host resources. The bypass feature applies to any assembly signed with a strong name and having the following characteristics: Fully trusted without the StrongName evidence (for example, has MyComputer zone evidence). Loaded into a fully trusted AppDomain. Loaded from a location under the ApplicationBase property of that AppDomain. Not delay-signed. Not validating the certificates used to sign strong name assemblies will provide a faster application load time, but falsely assumes that signatures used to sign the application are to be implicitly trusted. Not validating strong name certificates introduces an integrity risk to the system. |
| V-81495 | RegistryRule | Registry | Use of the RC4 cipher in TLS could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and recover plaintext from encrypted sessions. Applications that target .Net version 4.x running on multiple Windows versions could be vulnerable to these types of attacks. The registry settings in this requirement will prevent .Net applications that target the 4.x framework from selecting and utilizing the Schannel.dll RC4 cipher for TLS connections. Applications that use TLS when connecting to remote systems will perform a handshake and negotiate the TLS version and cipher that is to be used between the client and the server. This is standard protocol for all TLS connections. If the server and client are not configured to use the same TLS version and cipher, the TLS connection may fail. Applications should be tested with these registry settings prior to production implementation of the fix in order to avoid application outages. |

## MS Dot Net Framework, Version 1.9

**Title:** Microsoft DotNet Framework 4.0 STIG
**Version:** 1
**Release:** Release: 9 Benchmark Date: 25 Oct 2019

## Mozilla FireFox STIG, Version 4.26

**Title:** Mozilla FireFox Security Technical Implementation Guide
**Version:** 4
**Release:** Release: 26 Benchmark Date: 26 Jul 2019
**FileName:** U_Mozilla_FireFox_STIG_V4R26_Manual-xccdf.xml
**Created:** 8/8/2019
**Description:** The Mozilla FireFox Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via e-mail to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-15768 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | When a web site asks for a certificate for user authentication, Firefox must be configured to have the user choose which certificate to present. Websites within DOD require user authentication for access which increases security for DoD information. Access will be denied to the user if certificate management is not configured. |
| V-15771 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | Although current versions of Firefox have this set to disabled by default, use of this option can be harmful. This would allow the browser to access the Windows shell. This could allow access to the underlying system. This check verifies that the default setting has not been changed.  |
| V-15772 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | New file types cannot be added directly to the helper applications or plugins listing. Files with these extensions will not be allowed to use Firefox publicly available plugins and extensions to open. The application will be configured to open these files using external applications only. After a helper application or save to disk download action has been set, that action will be taken automatically for those types of files. When the user receives a dialog box asking if you want to save the file or open it with a specified application, this indicates that a plugin does not exist. The user has not previously selected a download action or helper application to automatically use for that type of file. When prompted, if the user checks the option to Do this automatically for files like this from now on, then an entry will appear for that type of file in the plugins listing and this file type is automatically opened in the future. This can be a security issue. New file types cannot be added directly to the Application plugin listing.  |
| V-15774 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | In order to protect privacy and sensitive data, Firefox provides the ability to configure Firefox such that data entered into forms is not saved. This mitigates the risk of a website gleaning private information from prefilled information. |
| V-15775 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | While on the internet, it may be possible for an attacker to view the saved password files and gain access to the user's accounts on various hosts.  |
| V-15776 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | Firefox can be set to store passwords for sites visited by the user. These individual passwords are stored in a file and can be protected by a master password. Autofill of the password can then be enabled when the site is visited. This feature could also be used to autofill the certificate pin which could lead to compromise of DoD information. |
| V-15778 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | Popup windows may be used to launch an attack within a new browser window with altered settings. This setting blocks popup windows created while the page is loading. |
| V-15779 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | JavaScript can make changes to the browser’s appearance. This activity can help disguise an attack taking place in a minimized background window. Set browser setting to prevent scripts on visited websites from moving and resizing browser windows.  |
| V-15983.a | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | Use of versions prior to TLS 1.1 are not permitted. SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 contain a number of security flaws. These versions must be disabled in compliance with the Network Infrastructure and Secure Remote Computing STIGs. |
| V-15983.b | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | Use of versions prior to TLS 1.1 are not permitted. SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 contain a number of security flaws. These versions must be disabled in compliance with the Network Infrastructure and Secure Remote Computing STIGs. |
| V-15985 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | JavaScript can make changes to the browser’s appearance. Allowing a website to use JavaScript to raise and lower browser windows may disguise an attack. Browser windows may not be set as active via JavaScript.  |
| V-15986 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | A context menu (also known as a pop-up menu) is often used in a graphical user interface (GUI) and appears upon user interaction (e.g., a right mouse click). A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application. A website may execute JavaScript that can make changes to these context menus. This can help disguise an attack. Set this preference to "false" so that webpages will not be able to affect the context menu event. |
| V-19742 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | Set this to false to disable checking for updated versions of the Extensions/Themes. Automatic updates from untrusted sites puts the enclave at risk of attack and may override security settings. |
| V-19744 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | Updates need to be controlled and installed from authorized and trusted servers. This setting overrides a number of other settings which may direct the application to access external URLs. |
| V-64891 | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | A browser extension is a program that has been installed into the browser which adds functionality to it. Where a plug-in interacts only with a web page and usually a third party external application (Flash, Adobe Reader) an extension interacts with the browser program itself. Extensions are not embedded in web pages and must be downloaded and installed in order to work. Extensions allow browsers to avoid restrictions which apply to web pages. For example, a Chrome extension can be written to combine data from multiple domains and present it when a certain page is accessed which can be considered Cross Site Scripting. If a browser is configured to allow unrestricted use of extension then plug-ins can be loaded and installed from malicious sources and used on the browser.  |
| V-79053.a | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | There should be no background submission of technical and other information from DoD computers to Mozilla with portions posted publically. |
| V-79053.b | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | There should be no background submission of technical and other information from DoD computers to Mozilla with portions posted publically. |
| V-79053.c | FileContentRule | ReplaceText | There should be no background submission of technical and other information from DoD computers to Mozilla with portions posted publically. |

When debugging or trace information is enabled in a production web browser, information about the web browser, such as web browser type, version, patches installed, plug-ins and modules installed, type of code being used by the hosted application, and any back-ends being used for data storage may be displayed. Since this information may be placed in logs and general messages during normal operation of the web browser, an attacker does not need to cause an error condition to gain this information. |

## IIS 8-5 Server STIG, Version 1.7

**Title:** IIS 8.5 Server Security Technical Implementation Guide
**Version:** 1
**Release:** Release: 7 Benchmark Date: 26 Apr 2019

**Created:** 9/19/2019
**Description:** This Security Technical Implementation Guide is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. The requirements are derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 and related documents. Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via email to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| V-76681 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Log files are a critical component to the successful management of an IS used within the DoD. By generating log files with useful information web administrators can leverage them in the event of a disaster, malicious attack, or other site specific needs. Ascertaining the correct order of the events that occurred is important during forensic analysis. Events that appear harmless by themselves might be flagged as a potential threat when properly viewed in sequence. By also establishing the event date and time, an event can be properly viewed with an enterprise tool to fully see a possible threat in its entirety. Without sufficient information establishing when the log event occurred, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000093-WSR-000053, SRG-APP-000095-WSR-000056, SRG-APP-000096-WSR-000057, SRG-APP-000097-WSR-000058, SRG-APP-000097-WSR-000059 |
| V-76683 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Internet Information Services (IIS) on Windows Server 2012 provides basic logging capabilities. However, because IIS takes some time to flush logs to disk, administrators do not have access to logging information in real-time. In addition, text-based log files can be difficult and time-consuming to process. In IIS 8.5, the administrator has the option of sending logging information to Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). This option gives the administrator the ability to use standard query tools, or create custom tools, for viewing real-time logging information in ETW. This provides a significant advantage over parsing text-based log files that are not updated in real time. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000108-WSR-000166, SRG-APP-000358-WSR-000063 |
| V-76687 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. Ascertaining the success or failure of an event is important during forensic analysis. Correctly determining the outcome will add information to the overall reconstruction of the logable event. By determining the success or failure of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken to determine if events tied to the event occurred in other areas within the enterprise. Without sufficient information establishing the success or failure of the logged event, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. The success or failure also provides a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked. |
| V-76689 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. Determining user accounts, processes running on behalf of the user, and running process identifiers also enable a better understanding of the overall event. User tool identification is also helpful to determine if events are related to overall user access or specific client tools. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. |
| V-76711.a | MimeTypeRule | xIisMimeTypeMapping | Controlling what a user of a hosted application can access is part of the security posture of the web server. Any time a user can access more functionality than is needed for the operation of the hosted application poses a security issue. A user with too much access can view information that is not needed for the user's job role, or the user could use the function in an unintentional manner. A MIME tells the web server what type of program, various file types, and extensions are and what external utilities or programs are needed to execute the file type. A shell is a program that serves as the basic interface between the user and the operating system, so hosted application users must not have access to these programs. Shell programs may execute shell escapes and can then perform unauthorized activities that could damage the security posture of the web server. |
| V-76711.b | MimeTypeRule | xIisMimeTypeMapping | Controlling what a user of a hosted application can access is part of the security posture of the web server.

| V-76745 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | This check verifies the key web server system configuration files are owned by the SA or the web administrator controlled account. These same files that control the configuration of the web server, and thus its behavior, must also be accessible by the account running the web service. If these files are altered by a malicious user, the web server would no longer be under the control of its managers and owners; properties in the web server configuration could be altered to compromise the entire server platform. |
| V-76759.a | RegistryRule | Registry | Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting for a private web server. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. A private web server must use a FIPS 140-2-approved TLS version, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled. FIPS 140-2-approved TLS versions include TLS V1.1 or greater. NIST SP 800-52 specifies the preferred configurations for government systems. |

| V-76681 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Log files are a critical component to the successful management of an IS used within the DoD. By generating log files with useful information web administrators can leverage them in the event of a disaster, malicious attack, or other site specific needs. Ascertaining the correct order of the events that occurred is important during forensic analysis. Events that appear harmless by themselves might be flagged as a potential threat when properly viewed in sequence. By also establishing the event date and time, an event can be properly viewed with an enterprise tool to fully see a possible threat in its entirety. Without sufficient information establishing when the log event occurred, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000093-WSR-000053, SRG-APP-000095-WSR-000056, SRG-APP-000096-WSR-000057, SRG-APP-000097-WSR-000058, SRG-APP-000097-WSR-000059 |
| V-76683 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Internet Information Services (IIS) on Windows Server 2012 provides basic logging capabilities. However, because IIS takes some time to flush logs to disk, administrators do not have access to logging information in real-time. In addition, text-based log files can be difficult and time-consuming to process. In IIS 8.5, the administrator has the option of sending logging information to Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). This option gives the administrator the ability to use standard query tools, or create custom tools, for viewing real-time logging information in ETW. This provides a significant advantage over parsing text-based log files that are not updated in real time. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000108-WSR-000166, SRG-APP-000358-WSR-000063 |
| V-76687 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. Ascertaining the success or failure of an event is important during forensic analysis. Correctly determining the outcome will add information to the overall reconstruction of the logable event. By determining the success or failure of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken to determine if events tied to the event occurred in other areas within the enterprise. Without sufficient information establishing the success or failure of the logged event, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. The success or failure also provides a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked. |
| V-76689 | IisLoggingRule | xIISLogging | Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. Determining user accounts, processes running on behalf of the user, and running process identifiers also enable a better understanding of the overall event. User tool identification is also helpful to determine if events are related to overall user access or specific client tools. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. |
| V-76711.a | MimeTypeRule | xIisMimeTypeMapping | Controlling what a user of a hosted application can access is part of the security posture of the web server. Any time a user can access more functionality than is needed for the operation of the hosted application poses a security issue. A user with too much access can view information that is not needed for the user's job role, or the user could use the function in an unintentional manner. A MIME tells the web server what type of program, various file types, and extensions are and what external utilities or programs are needed to execute the file type. A shell is a program that serves as the basic interface between the user and the operating system, so hosted application users must not have access to these programs. Shell programs may execute shell escapes and can then perform unauthorized activities that could damage the security posture of the web server. |

| V-76745 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | This check verifies the key web server system configuration files are owned by the SA or the web administrator controlled account. These same files that control the configuration of the web server, and thus its behavior, must also be accessible by the account running the web service. If these files are altered by a malicious user, the web server would no longer be under the control of its managers and owners; properties in the web server configuration could be altered to compromise the entire server platform. |

| V-76779 | SslSettingsRule | xSslSettings | Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting for a private web server. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. A private web server must use a FIPS 140-2-approved TLS version, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled. FIPS 140-2-approved TLS versions include TLS V1.1 or greater.

| V-76809 | SslSettingsRule | xSslSettings | A DoD private website must utilize PKI as an authentication mechanism for web users. Information systems residing behind web servers requiring authorization based on individual identity must use the identity provided by certificate-based authentication to support access control decisions. Not using client certificates allows an attacker unauthenticated access to private websites. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000172-WSR-000104, SRG-APP-000224-WSR-000135, SRG-APP-000427-WSR-000186 |
| V-76851 | SslSettingsRule | xSslSettings | When data is written to digital media, such as hard drives, mobile computers, external/removable hard drives, personal digital assistants, flash/thumb drives, etc., there is risk of data loss and data compromise. User identities and passwords stored on the hard drive of the hosting hardware must be encrypted to protect the data from easily being discovered and used by an unauthorized user to access the hosted applications. The cryptographic libraries and functionality used to store and retrieve the user identifiers and passwords must be part of the web server. Preventing the disclosure of transmitted information requires that the web server take measures to employ some form of cryptographic mechanism in order to protect the information during transmission. This is usually achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS). Transmission of data can take place between the web server and a large number of devices/applications external to the web server. Examples are a web client used by a user, a backend database, an audit server, or other web servers in a web cluster. If data is transmitted unencrypted, the data then becomes vulnerable to disclosure. The disclosure may reveal user identifier/password combinations, website code revealing business logic, or other user personal information. Also satisfies: SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000151 |
| V-76861 | SslSettingsRule | None | Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during preparation for transmission, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information. An example of this would be an SMTP queue. This queue may be added to a web server through an SMTP module to enhance error reporting or to allow developers to add SMTP functionality to their applications. Any modules used by the web server that queue data before transmission must maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information before the data is transmitted. Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during reception, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of received information requires that application servers take measures to employ approved cryptography in order to protect the information during transmission over the network. This is usually achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), SSL VPN, or IPsec tunnel. The web server must utilize approved encryption when receiving transmitted data. Also satisfies: SRG-APP-000442-WSR-000182 |
| V-76839 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | The idle time-out attribute controls the amount of time a worker process will remain idle before it shuts down. A worker process is idle if it is not processing requests and no new requests are received. The purpose of this attribute is to conserve system resources; the default value for idle time-out is 20 minutes. By default, the World Wide Web (WWW) service establishes an overlapped recycle, in which the worker process to be shut down is kept running until after a new worker process is started. |
| V-76867 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | IIS application pools can be periodically recycled to avoid unstable states possibly leading to application crashes, hangs, or memory leaks. By default, application pool recycling is overlapped, which means the worker process to be shut down is kept running until after a new worker process is started. After a new worker process starts, new requests are passed to it. The old worker process shuts down after it finishes processing its existing requests, or after a configured time-out, whichever comes first. This way of recycling ensures uninterrupted service to clients. |

| V-76875 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | In order to determine the possible causes of client connection errors and to conserve system resources, it is important to both log errors and manage those settings controlling requests to the application pool. |
| V-76877 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) manages application pool configurations and may flag a worker process as unhealthy and shut it down. An application pool’s pinging monitor must be enabled to confirm worker processes are functional. A lack of response from the worker process might mean the worker process does not have a thread to respond to the ping request, or it is hanging for some other reason. The ping interval and ping response time may need adjustment to gain access to timely information about application pool health without triggering false, unhealthy conditions; for example, instability caused by an application. |
| V-76879 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | Rapid fail protection is a feature that interrogates the health of worker processes associated with websites and web applications. It can be configured to perform a number of actions such as shutting down and restarting worker processes that have reached failure thresholds. By not setting rapid fail protection the web server could become unstable in the event of a worker process crash potentially leaving the web server unusable. |
| V-76881 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) manages application pool configuration and may flag a worker process as unhealthy and shut it down. The rapid fail protection must be set to a suitable value. A lack of response from the worker process might mean the worker process does not have a thread to respond to the ping request, or that it is hanging for some other reason. The ping interval and ping response time may need adjustment to gain access to timely information about application pool health without triggering false, unhealthy conditions. |
| V-76775 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | When the session information is stored on the client, the session ID, along with the user authorization and identity information, is sent along with each client request and is stored in either a cookie, embedded in the uniform resource locator (URL), or placed in a hidden field on the displayed form. Each of these offers advantages and disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage to all three is the hijacking of a session along with all of the user's credentials. When the user authorization and identity information is stored on the server in a protected and encrypted database, the communication between the client and web server will only send the session identifier, and the server can then retrieve user credentials for the session when needed. If, during transmission, the session were to be hijacked, the user's credentials would not be compromised. ASP.NET provides a session state, which is available as the HttpSessionState class, as a method of storing session-specific information that is visible only within the session. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides the ability to persist variable values for the duration of that session. |

ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides the ability to persist variable values for the duration of that session. Cookies associate session information with client information for the duration of a user’s connection to a website. Using cookies is a more efficient way to track session state than any of the methods that do not use cookies because cookies do not require any redirection.  |
| V-76805 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | A web server may host too many applications. Each application will need certain system resources and privileged operations to operate correctly. An application's trust level determines the permissions granted by the ASP.NET Code Access Security (CAS) policy. An application with full trust permissions may access all resource types on a server and perform privileged operations, while applications running with partial trust have varying levels of operating permissions and access to resources. The CAS determines the permissions granted to the application on the server. Setting a level of trust compatible with the applications will limit the potential harm a compromised application could cause to a system. The web server must be configured to contain and control the applications and protect the system resources and privileged operations from those not needed by the application for operation. Limiting the application will confine the potential harm a compromised application could cause to a system. |
| V-76813 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | None | Communication between a client and the web server is done using the HTTP protocol, but HTTP is a stateless protocol. In order to maintain a connection or session, a web server will generate a session identifier (ID) for each client session when the session is initiated. The session ID allows the web server to track a user session and, in many cases, the user, if the user previously logged into a hosted application. By being able to guess session IDs, an attacker can easily perform a man-in-the-middle attack. To truly generate random session identifiers that cannot be reproduced, the web server session ID generator, when used twice with the same input criteria, must generate an unrelated random ID. The session ID generator also needs to be a FIPS 140-2-approved generator. |
| V-76817 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Request filtering replaces URLScan in IIS, enabling administrators to create a more granular rule set with which to allow or reject inbound web content. By setting limits on web requests, it helps to ensure availability of web services and may also help mitigate the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The MaxURL Request Filter limits the number of bytes the server will accept in a URL. |
| V-76819 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | By setting limits on web requests, it ensures availability of web services and mitigates the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The maxAllowedContentLength Request Filter limits the number of bytes the server will accept in a request. |
| V-76821 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | By setting limits on web requests, it helps to ensure availability of web services and may also help mitigate the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The Maximum Query String Request Filter describes the upper limit on allowable query string lengths. Upon exceeding the configured value, IIS will generate a Status Code 404.15. |
| V-76823 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | By setting limits on web requests, it ensures availability of web services and mitigates the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The allow high-bit characters Request Filter enables rejection of requests containing non-ASCII characters. |
| V-76825 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Request filtering enables administrators to create a more granular rule set with which to allow or reject inbound web content. By setting limits on web requests, it ensures availability of web services and mitigates the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. When the “Allow double escaping” option is disabled it prevents attacks that rely on double-encoded requests. |
| V-76827 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Request filtering enables administrators to create a more granular rule set to allow or reject inbound web content. By setting limits on web requests it helps to ensure availability of web services and may also help mitigate the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The allow unlisted property of the “File Extensions Request” filter enables rejection of requests containing specific file extensions not defined in the “File Extensions” filter. Tripping this filter will cause IIS to generate a Status Code 404.7. |
| V-76829 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | rectory browsing allows the contents of a directory to be displayed upon request from a web client. If directory browsing is enabled for a directory in IIS, users could receive a web page listing the contents of the directory. If directory browsing is enabled the risk of inadvertently disclosing sensitive content is increased. |
| V-76835 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | HTTP error pages contain information that could enable an attacker to gain access to an information system. Failure to prevent the sending of HTTP error pages with full information to remote requesters exposes internal configuration information to potential attackers. |
| V-76837 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Setting compilation debug to false ensures detailed error information does not inadvertently display during live application usage, mitigating the risk of application information being displayed to users. |
| V-76841 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Leaving sessions open indefinitely is a major security risk. An attacker can easily use an already authenticated session to access the hosted application as the previously authenticated user. By closing sessions after a set period of inactivity, the web server can make certain that those sessions that are not closed through the user logging out of an application are eventually closed. Acceptable values are 5 minutes for high-value applications, 10 minutes for medium-value applications, and 20 minutes for low-value applications. |
| V-76855 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | The HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. To maintain a session, a session identifier is used. The session identifier is a piece of data that is used to identify a session and a user. If the session identifier is compromised by an attacker, the session can be hijacked. By encrypting the session identifier, the identifier becomes more difficult for an attacker to hijack, decrypt, and use before the session has expired. |
| V-76859.a | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | A cookie is used when a web server needs to share data with the client's browser. The data is often used to remember the client when the client returns to the hosted application at a later date. A session cookie is a special type of cookie used to remember the client during the session. The cookie will contain the session identifier (ID) and may contain authentication data to the hosted application. To protect this data from easily being compromised, the cookie must be encrypted. When a cookie is sent encrypted via SSL/TLS, an attacker must spend a great deal of time and resources to decrypt the cookie. If, along with encryption, the cookie is compressed, the attacker can now use a combination of plaintext injection and inadvertent information leakage through data compression to reduce the time needed to decrypt the cookie. This attack is called Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME). Cookies shared between the web server and the client when encrypted should not also be compressed. A cookie can be read by client-side scripts easily if cookie properties are not set properly. By allowing cookies to be read by the client-side scripts, information such as session identifiers could be compromised and used by an attacker who intercepts the cookie. Setting cookie properties (i.e. HttpOnly property) to disallow client-side scripts from reading cookies better protects the information inside the cookie. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000154, SRG-APP-000439-SSR-000155, SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000153 |

| V-76803 | WindowsFeatureRule | WindowsFeature | A web server can be installed with functionality that, just by its nature, is not secure. Web Distributed Authoring (WebDAV) is an extension to the HTTP protocol that, when developed, was meant to allow users to create, change, and move documents on a server, typically a web server or web share. Allowing this functionality, development, and deployment is much easier for web authors. WebDAV is not widely used and has serious security concerns because it may allow clients to modify unauthorized files on the web server. |

| V-76783 | IisLoggingRule | XWebsite | Log files are a critical component to the successful management of an IS used within the DoD. By generating log files with useful information web administrators can leverage them in the event of a disaster, malicious attack, or other site-specific needs. Ascertaining the correct order of the events that occurred is important during forensic analysis. Events that appear harmless by themselves might be flagged as a potential threat when properly viewed in sequence. By also establishing the event date and time, an event can be properly viewed with an enterprise tool to fully see a possible threat in its entirety. Without sufficient information establishing when the log event occurred, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000093-WSR-000053 |
| V-76785 | IisLoggingRule | XWebsite | Internet Information Services (IIS) on Windows Server 2012 provides basic logging capabilities. However, because IIS takes some time to flush logs to disk, administrators do not have access to logging information in real-time. In addition, text-based log files can be difficult and time-consuming to process. In IIS 8.5, the administrator has the option of sending logging information to Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). This option gives the administrator the ability to use standard query tools, or create custom tools, for viewing real-time logging information in ETW. This provides a significant advantage over parsing text-based log files that are not updated in real time. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000108-WSR-000166 |
| V-76789 | IisLoggingRule | XWebsite | Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. Ascertaining the success or failure of an event is important during forensic analysis. Correctly determining the outcome will add information to the overall reconstruction of the logable event. By determining the success or failure of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken to determine if events tied to the event occurred in other areas within the enterprise. Without sufficient information establishing the success or failure of the logged event, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. The success or failure also provides a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked. |
| V-76791 | IisLoggingRule | XWebsite | Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined. Determining user accounts, processes running on behalf of the user, and running process identifiers also enable a better understanding of the overall event. User tool identification is also helpful to determine if events are related to overall user access or specific client tools. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. |

| V-76851 | SslSettingsRule | xSslSettings | When data is written to digital media, such as hard drives, mobile computers, external/removable hard drives, personal digital assistants, flash/thumb drives, etc., there is risk of data loss and data compromise. User identities and passwords stored on the hard drive of the hosting hardware must be encrypted to protect the data from easily being discovered and used by an unauthorized user to access the hosted applications. The cryptographic libraries and functionality used to store and retrieve the user identifiers and passwords must be part of the web server. Preventing the disclosure of transmitted information requires that the web server take measures to employ some form of cryptographic mechanism in order to protect the information during transmission. This is usually achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS). Transmission of data can take place between the web server and a large number of devices/applications external to the web server. Examples are a web client used by a user, a backend database, an audit server, or other web servers in a web cluster. If data is transmitted unencrypted, the data then becomes vulnerable to disclosure. The disclosure may reveal user identifier/password combinations, website code revealing business logic, or other user personal information. Also satisfies: SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000151 |
| V-76861 | SslSettingsRule | None | Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during preparation for transmission, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information. An example of this would be an SMTP queue. This queue may be added to a web server through an SMTP module to enhance error reporting or to allow developers to add SMTP functionality to their applications. Any modules used by the web server that queue data before transmission must maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information before the data is transmitted. Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during reception, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of received information requires that application servers take measures to employ approved cryptography in order to protect the information during transmission over the network. This is usually achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), SSL VPN, or IPsec tunnel. The web server must utilize approved encryption when receiving transmitted data. Also satisfies: SRG-APP-000442-WSR-000182 |
| V-76839 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | The idle time-out attribute controls the amount of time a worker process will remain idle before it shuts down. A worker process is idle if it is not processing requests and no new requests are received. The purpose of this attribute is to conserve system resources; the default value for idle time-out is 20 minutes. By default, the World Wide Web (WWW) service establishes an overlapped recycle, in which the worker process to be shut down is kept running until after a new worker process is started. |
| V-76867 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | IIS application pools can be periodically recycled to avoid unstable states possibly leading to application crashes, hangs, or memory leaks. By default, application pool recycling is overlapped, which means the worker process to be shut down is kept running until after a new worker process is started. After a new worker process starts, new requests are passed to it. The old worker process shuts down after it finishes processing its existing requests, or after a configured time-out, whichever comes first. This way of recycling ensures uninterrupted service to clients. |

| V-76873 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | Application pools can be periodically recycled to avoid unstable states possibly leading to application crashes, hangs, or memory leaks. |
| V-76875 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | In order to determine the possible causes of client connection errors and to conserve system resources, it is important to both log errors and manage those settings controlling requests to the application pool. |
| V-76877 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) manages application pool configurations and may flag a worker process as unhealthy and shut it down. An application pool’s pinging monitor must be enabled to confirm worker processes are functional. A lack of response from the worker process might mean the worker process does not have a thread to respond to the ping request, or it is hanging for some other reason. The ping interval and ping response time may need adjustment to gain access to timely information about application pool health without triggering false, unhealthy conditions; for example, instability caused by an application. |
| V-76879 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | Rapid fail protection is a feature that interrogates the health of worker processes associated with websites and web applications. It can be configured to perform a number of actions such as shutting down and restarting worker processes that have reached failure thresholds. By not setting rapid fail protection the web server could become unstable in the event of a worker process crash potentially leaving the web server unusable. |
| V-76881 | WebAppPoolRule | xWebAppPool | Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) manages application pool configuration and may flag a worker process as unhealthy and shut it down. The rapid fail protection must be set to a suitable value. A lack of response from the worker process might mean the worker process does not have a thread to respond to the ping request, or that it is hanging for some other reason. The ping interval and ping response time may need adjustment to gain access to timely information about application pool health without triggering false, unhealthy conditions. |
| V-76775 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | When the session information is stored on the client, the session ID, along with the user authorization and identity information, is sent along with each client request and is stored in either a cookie, embedded in the uniform resource locator (URL), or placed in a hidden field on the displayed form. Each of these offers advantages and disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage to all three is the hijacking of a session along with all of the user's credentials. When the user authorization and identity information is stored on the server in a protected and encrypted database, the communication between the client and web server will only send the session identifier, and the server can then retrieve user credentials for the session when needed. If, during transmission, the session were to be hijacked, the user's credentials would not be compromised. ASP.NET provides a session state, which is available as the HttpSessionState class, as a method of storing session-specific information that is visible only within the session. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides the ability to persist variable values for the duration of that session. |

ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides the ability to persist variable values for the duration of that session. Cookies associate session information with client information for the duration of a user’s connection to a website. Using cookies is a more efficient way to track session state than any of the methods that do not use cookies because cookies do not require any redirection.  |
| V-76805 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | A web server may host too many applications. Each application will need certain system resources and privileged operations to operate correctly. An application's trust level determines the permissions granted by the ASP.NET Code Access Security (CAS) policy. An application with full trust permissions may access all resource types on a server and perform privileged operations, while applications running with partial trust have varying levels of operating permissions and access to resources. The CAS determines the permissions granted to the application on the server. Setting a level of trust compatible with the applications will limit the potential harm a compromised application could cause to a system. The web server must be configured to contain and control the applications and protect the system resources and privileged operations from those not needed by the application for operation. Limiting the application will confine the potential harm a compromised application could cause to a system. |
| V-76813 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | None | Communication between a client and the web server is done using the HTTP protocol, but HTTP is a stateless protocol. In order to maintain a connection or session, a web server will generate a session identifier (ID) for each client session when the session is initiated. The session ID allows the web server to track a user session and, in many cases, the user, if the user previously logged into a hosted application. By being able to guess session IDs, an attacker can easily perform a man-in-the-middle attack. To truly generate random session identifiers that cannot be reproduced, the web server session ID generator, when used twice with the same input criteria, must generate an unrelated random ID. The session ID generator also needs to be a FIPS 140-2-approved generator. |
| V-76817 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Request filtering replaces URLScan in IIS, enabling administrators to create a more granular rule set with which to allow or reject inbound web content. By setting limits on web requests, it helps to ensure availability of web services and may also help mitigate the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The MaxURL Request Filter limits the number of bytes the server will accept in a URL. |
| V-76819 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | By setting limits on web requests, it ensures availability of web services and mitigates the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The maxAllowedContentLength Request Filter limits the number of bytes the server will accept in a request. |
| V-76821 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | By setting limits on web requests, it helps to ensure availability of web services and may also help mitigate the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The Maximum Query String Request Filter describes the upper limit on allowable query string lengths. Upon exceeding the configured value, IIS will generate a Status Code 404.15. |
| V-76823 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | By setting limits on web requests, it ensures availability of web services and mitigates the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The allow high-bit characters Request Filter enables rejection of requests containing non-ASCII characters. |
| V-76825 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Request filtering enables administrators to create a more granular rule set with which to allow or reject inbound web content. By setting limits on web requests, it ensures availability of web services and mitigates the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. When the “Allow double escaping” option is disabled it prevents attacks that rely on double-encoded requests. |
| V-76827 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Request filtering enables administrators to create a more granular rule set to allow or reject inbound web content. By setting limits on web requests it helps to ensure availability of web services and may also help mitigate the risk of buffer overflow type attacks. The allow unlisted property of the “File Extensions Request” filter enables rejection of requests containing specific file extensions not defined in the “File Extensions” filter. Tripping this filter will cause IIS to generate a Status Code 404.7. |
| V-76829 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | rectory browsing allows the contents of a directory to be displayed upon request from a web client. If directory browsing is enabled for a directory in IIS, users could receive a web page listing the contents of the directory. If directory browsing is enabled the risk of inadvertently disclosing sensitive content is increased. |
| V-76835 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | HTTP error pages contain information that could enable an attacker to gain access to an information system. Failure to prevent the sending of HTTP error pages with full information to remote requesters exposes internal configuration information to potential attackers. |
| V-76837 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Setting compilation debug to false ensures detailed error information does not inadvertently display during live application usage, mitigating the risk of application information being displayed to users. |
| V-76841 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | Leaving sessions open indefinitely is a major security risk. An attacker can easily use an already authenticated session to access the hosted application as the previously authenticated user. By closing sessions after a set period of inactivity, the web server can make certain that those sessions that are not closed through the user logging out of an application are eventually closed. Acceptable values are 5 minutes for high-value applications, 10 minutes for medium-value applications, and 20 minutes for low-value applications. |
| V-76855 | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | The HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. To maintain a session, a session identifier is used. The session identifier is a piece of data that is used to identify a session and a user. If the session identifier is compromised by an attacker, the session can be hijacked. By encrypting the session identifier, the identifier becomes more difficult for an attacker to hijack, decrypt, and use before the session has expired. |
| V-76859.a | WebConfigurationPropertyRule | xWebConfigKeyValue | A cookie is used when a web server needs to share data with the client's browser. The data is often used to remember the client when the client returns to the hosted application at a later date. A session cookie is a special type of cookie used to remember the client during the session. The cookie will contain the session identifier (ID) and may contain authentication data to the hosted application. To protect this data from easily being compromised, the cookie must be encrypted. When a cookie is sent encrypted via SSL/TLS, an attacker must spend a great deal of time and resources to decrypt the cookie. If, along with encryption, the cookie is compressed, the attacker can now use a combination of plaintext injection and inadvertent information leakage through data compression to reduce the time needed to decrypt the cookie. This attack is called Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME). Cookies shared between the web server and the client when encrypted should not also be compressed. A cookie can be read by client-side scripts easily if cookie properties are not set properly. By allowing cookies to be read by the client-side scripts, information such as session identifiers could be compromised and used by an attacker who intercepts the cookie. Setting cookie properties (i.e. HttpOnly property) to disallow client-side scripts from reading cookies better protects the information inside the cookie. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000154, SRG-APP-000439-SSR-000155, SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000153 |

| V-76803 | WindowsFeatureRule | WindowsFeature | A web server can be installed with functionality that, just by its nature, is not secure. Web Distributed Authoring (WebDAV) is an extension to the HTTP protocol that, when developed, was meant to allow users to create, change, and move documents on a server, typically a web server or web share. Allowing this functionality, development, and deployment is much easier for web authors. WebDAV is not widely used and has serious security concerns because it may allow clients to modify unauthorized files on the web server. |

Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via e-mail to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-46473 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This parameter ensures only DoD-approved ciphers and algorithms are enabled for use by the web browser by allowing you to turn on/off support for TLS and SSL. TLS is a protocol for protecting communications between the browser and the target server. When the browser attempts to set up a protected communication with the target server, the browser and server negotiate which protocol and version to use. The browser and server attempt to match each other's list of supported protocols and versions and pick the most preferred match.. |
| V-46475 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This parameter warns users if the certificate being presented by the website is invalid. Since server certificates are used to validate the identity of the web server it is critical to warn the user of a potential issue with the certificate being presented by the web server. This setting aids to prevent spoofing attacks. |
| V-46477 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Check for publisher's certificate revocation options should be enforced to ensure all PKI signed objects are validated. |
| V-46481 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Active X controls can contain potentially malicious code and must only be allowed to be downloaded from trusted sites. Signed code is better than unsigned code in that it may be easier to determine its author, but it is still potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. This policy setting allows you to manage whether users may download signed ActiveX controls from a page in the zone. If you enable this policy, users can download signed controls without user intervention. If you select Prompt in the drop-down box, users are queried whether to download controls signed by untrusted publishers. Code signed by trusted publishers is silently downloaded. If you disable the policy setting, signed controls cannot be downloaded. |
| V-46483 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Unsigned code is potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. This policy setting allows you to manage whether users may download unsigned ActiveX controls from the zone. If you enable this policy setting, users can run unsigned controls without user intervention. If you select "Prompt" in the drop-down box, users are queried to choose whether to allow the unsigned control to run. If you disable this policy setting, users cannot run unsigned controls. If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot run unsigned controls. |
| V-46501 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls that are not marked safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. This setting causes both unsafe and safe controls to be initialized and scripted, ignoring the Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting option. This increases the risk of malicious code being loaded and executed by the browser. If you enable this policy setting, ActiveX controls are run, loaded with parameters and scripted without setting object safety for untrusted data or scripts. If you disable this policy setting, ActiveX controls that cannot be made safe are not loaded with parameters or scripted. This setting is not recommended, except for secure and administered zones. |
| V-46507 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code; sites located in this security zone are more likely to be hosted by malicious individuals. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually. Use of the Low Safety permission enables applets to perform all operations. Use of the Medium Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox (an area in memory outside of which the program cannot make calls), plus adds capabilities like scratch space (a safe and secure storage area on the client computer) and a user-controlled file I/O. Use of the High Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox. If you disable this policy setting, Java applets cannot run. If you do not configure this policy setting, the permission is set to High Safety. |
| V-46509 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The ability to access data zones across domains could cause the user to unknowingly access content hosted on an unauthorized server. Access to data sources across multiple domains must be controlled based upon the site being browsed. This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer can access data from another security zone using the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) or ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). |
| V-46511 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Content hosted on sites located in the Internet zone are likely to contain malicious payloads and therefore this feature should be blocked for this zone. Drag and drop or copy and paste files must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. |
| V-46513 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether applications may be run and files may be downloaded from an IFRAME reference in the HTML of the pages in this zone. Launching of programs in IFRAME must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. If you enable this policy setting, applications can run and files can be downloaded from IFRAMEs on the pages in this zone without user intervention. If you disable this setting, users are prevented from running applications and downloading files from IFRAMEs on the pages in this zone. |
| V-46515 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Frames that navigate across different domains are a security concern, because the user may think they are accessing pages on one site while they are actually accessing pages on another site. It is possible that a website hosting malicious content could use this feature in a manner similar to cross-site scripting (XSS). This policy setting allows you to manage the opening of sub-frames and access of applications across different domains. |
| V-46517 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Userdata persistence must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. It is possible for sites hosting malicious content to exploit this feature as part of an attack against visitors browsing the site. This policy setting allows you to manage the preservation of information in the browser's history, in Favorites, in an XML store, or directly within a web page saved to disk. When a user returns to a persisted page, the state of the page can be restored if this policy setting is not appropriately configured.  |
| V-46521 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A malicious script could use the clipboard in an undesirable manner, for example, if the user had recently copied confidential information to the clipboard while editing a document, a malicious script could harvest that information. It might be possible to exploit other vulnerabilities in order to send the harvested data to the attacker. Allow paste operations via script must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. |
| V-46523 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users could submit credentials to servers operated by malicious individuals who could then attempt to connect to legitimate servers with those captured credentials. Care must be taken with user credentials, automatic logon performance, and how default Windows credentials are passed to the websites. This policy setting allows management of settings for logon options. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from varying logon options. “Anonymous logon” disables HTTP authentication and uses the guest account only for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. “Prompt for user name and password” queries users for user IDs and passwords. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone” queries users for user IDs and passwords in other zones. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon with current user name and password” attempts logon using Windows NT Challenge Response. If Windows NT Challenge Response is supported by the server, the logon uses the user's network user name and password for login. If Windows NT Challenge Response is not supported by the server, the user is queried to provide the user name and password. If you disable this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”. If you do not configure this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”. The most secure option is to configure this setting to “Enabled”; “Anonymous logon”, but configuring this setting to “Enabled”; “Prompt for user name and password”, provides a reasonable balance between security and usability. |
| V-46525 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually. Use of the Low Safety permission enables applets to perform all operations. Use of the Medium Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox (an area in memory outside of which the program cannot make calls), plus adds capabilities like scratch space (a safe and secure storage area on the client computer) and a user-controlled file I/O. Use of the High Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox. If you disable this policy setting, Java applets cannot run. If you do not configure this policy setting, the permission is set to High Safety. |
| V-46543 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually.

If you do not configure this policy setting, the permission is set to High Safety |
| V-46545 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to set options for dragging content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. If you enable this policy setting, users can drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. Users cannot change this setting. If you disable this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. Users cannot change this setting in the Internet Options dialog box. If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. Users can change this setting in the Internet Options dialog box. |
| V-46547 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to set options for dragging content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. If you enable this policy setting, users can drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. Users cannot change this setting. If you enable this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when both the source and destination are in different windows. Users cannot change this setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. Users can change this setting in the Internet Options dialog box. |
| V-46549 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users often choose to install software such as ActiveX controls that are not permitted by their organization's security policy. Such software can pose significant security and privacy risks to networks. This policy setting enables blocking of ActiveX control installation prompts for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will be blocked for Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will not be blocked and these prompts will be displayed to users. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user's preference will be used to determine whether to block ActiveX control installations for Internet Explorer processes. |
| V-46553 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users often choose to install software such as ActiveX controls that are not permitted by their organization's security policy. Such software can pose significant security and privacy risks to networks. This policy setting enables blocking of ActiveX control installation prompts for Internet Explorer processes.

Signed code is better than unsigned code in that it may be easier to determine its author, but it is still potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. |
| V-46575 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Unsigned code is potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. ActiveX controls can contain potentially malicious code and must only be allowed to be downloaded from trusted sites. They must also be digitally signed. |
| V-46577 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. |
| V-46579 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether ActiveX controls and plug-ins can be run on pages from the specified zone. ActiveX controls not marked as safe should not be executed. If you enable this policy setting, controls and plug-ins can run without user intervention. If you disable this policy setting, controls and plug-ins are prevented from running. |
| V-46581 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows management of whether ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting can interact with a script. If you enable this policy setting, script interaction can occur automatically without user intervention. ActiveX controls not marked as safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. |
| V-46583 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Sites located in the Restricted Sites Zone are more likely to contain malicious payloads and therefore downloads from this zone should be blocked. Files should not be able to be downloaded from sites that are considered restricted. This policy setting allows you to manage whether file downloads are permitted from the zone. This option is determined by the zone of the page with the link causing the download, not the zone from which the file is delivered. |
| V-46587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code; sites located in this security zone are more likely to be hosted by malicious individuals. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually. Use of the Low Safety permission enables applets to perform all operations. Use of the Medium Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox (an area in memory outside of which the program cannot make calls), plus adds capabilities like scratch space (a safe and secure storage area on the client computer) and a user-controlled file I/O. Use of the High Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox. If you disable this policy setting, Java applets cannot run. If you do not configure this policy setting, the permission is set to High Safety. |
| V-46589 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The ability to access data zones across domains could cause the user to unknowingly access content hosted on an unauthorized server. This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer can access data from another security zone using the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) or ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). |
| V-46591 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | It is possible that users will unknowingly be redirected to a site hosting malicious content. 'Allow META REFRESH' must have a level of protection based upon the site being browsed. This policy setting allows you to manage whether a user's browser can be redirected to another web page if the author of the web page uses the Meta Refresh setting to redirect browsers to another web page. |
| V-46593 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Content hosted on sites located in the Restricted Sites zone are more likely to contain malicious payloads and therefore this feature should be blocked for this zone. Drag and drop or copy and paste files must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. |
| V-46597 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether applications may be run and files may be downloaded from an IFRAME reference in the HTML of the pages in this zone. Launching of programs in IFRAME must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. If you enable this policy setting, applications can run and files can be downloaded from IFRAMEs on the pages in this zone without user intervention. If you disable this setting, users are prevented from running applications and downloading files from IFRAMEs on the pages in this zone. |
| V-46599 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Frames navigating across different domains are a security concern, because the user may think they are accessing pages on one site while they are actually accessing pages on another site. It is possible that a website hosting malicious content could use this feature in a manner similar to cross-site scripting (XSS). This policy setting allows you to manage the opening of sub-frames and access of applications across different domains. |
| V-46601 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Userdata persistence must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. This policy setting allows you to manage the preservation of information in the browser's history, in Favorites, in an XML store, or directly within a web page saved to disk. When a user returns to a persisted page, the state of the page can be restored if this policy setting is not appropriately configured. |
| V-46603 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Active scripts hosted on sites located in this zone are more likely to contain malicious code. Active scripting must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. This policy setting allows you to manage whether script code on pages in the zone are run. |
| V-46605 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A malicious script could use the clipboard in an undesirable manner, for example, if the user had recently copied confidential information to the clipboard while editing a document, a malicious script could harvest that information. It might be possible to exploit other vulnerabilities in order to send the harvested data to the attacker. Allow paste operations via script must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. |
| V-46607 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users could submit credentials to servers operated by malicious individuals who could then attempt to connect to legitimate servers with those captured credentials. Care must be taken with user credentials, automatic logon performance, and how default Windows credentials are passed to the websites. This policy setting allows management of settings for logon options. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from varying logon options. “Anonymous logon” disables HTTP authentication and uses the guest account only for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. “Prompt for user name and password” queries users for user IDs and passwords. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone” queries users for user IDs and passwords in other zones. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon with current user name and password” attempts logon using Windows NT Challenge Response. If Windows NT Challenge Response is supported by the server, the logon uses the user's network user name and password for login. If Windows NT Challenge Response is not supported by the server, the user is queried to provide the user name and password. If you disable this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”. If you do not configure this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”. The most secure option is to configure this setting to “Enabled”; “Anonymous logon”. This will prevent users from submitting credentials to servers in this security zone. |
| V-46609.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The delete Browsing History option can be accessed using Tools, Internet Options, "General" tab, and then click Settings under Browsing History. If you enable this policy setting, a user cannot set the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List must be specified. Users will not be able to delete browsing history. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a user can set the number of days that Internet Explorer tracks views of pages in the History List. Users can delete browsing history. |
| V-46609.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The delete Browsing History option can be accessed using Tools, Internet Options, "General" tab, and then click Settings under Browsing History. If you enable this policy setting, a user cannot set the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List must be specified. Users will not be able to delete browsing history. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a user can set the number of days that Internet Explorer tracks views of pages in the History List. Users can delete browsing history. |
| V-46615 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting prevents users from adding sites to various security zones. Users should not be able to add sites to different zones, as this could allow them to bypass security controls of the system. If you do not configure this policy setting, users will be able to add or remove sites from the Trusted Sites and Restricted Sites zones at will and change settings in the Local Intranet zone. This configuration could allow sites that host malicious mobile code to be added to these zones, and users could execute the code. |
| V-46617 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users who change their Internet Explorer security settings could enable the execution of dangerous types of code from the Internet and websites listed in the Restricted Sites zone in the browser. This setting prevents users from changing the Internet Explorer policies on the machine. Policy changes should be made by administrators only, so this setting should be enabled. If you enable this policy setting, you disable the "Custom level" button and "Security" level for this zone slider on the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, users will be able to change the settings for security zones. It prevents users from changing security zone policy settings that are established by the administrator. |
| V-46619 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users who change their Internet Explorer security settings could enable the execution of dangerous types of code from the Internet and websites listed in the Restricted Sites zone in the browser. This setting enforces consistent security zone settings to all users of the computer. Security zones control browser behavior at various websites and it is desirable to maintain a consistent policy for all users of a machine. This policy setting affects how security zone changes apply to different users. If you enable this policy setting, changes that one user makes to a security zone will apply to all users of that computer. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, users of the same computer are allowed to establish their own security zone settings. |
| V-46621 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting turns off the Security Settings Check feature, which checks Internet Explorer security settings to determine when the settings put Internet Explorer at risk. If you enable this policy setting, the security settings check will not be performed. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the security settings check will be performed. |
| V-46625 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls and file downloads often have digital signatures attached that certify the file's integrity and the identity of the signer (creator) of the software. Such signatures help ensure unmodified software is downloaded and the user can positively identify the signer to determine whether you trust them enough to run their software. |
| V-46629 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer will check revocation status of servers' certificates. Certificates are revoked when they have been compromised or are no longer valid, and this option protects users from submitting confidential data to a site that may be fraudulent or not secure. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will check to see if server certificates have been revoked. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not check server certificates to see if they have been revoked. If you do not configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not check server certificates to see if they have been revoked. |
| V-46633 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer checks for digital signatures (which identifies the publisher of signed software and verifies it has not been modified or tampered with) on user computers before downloading executable programs. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will check the digital signatures of executable programs and display their identities before downloading them to the user computers. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not check the digital signatures of executable programs or display their identities before downloading them to the user computers. If you do not configure this policy, Internet Explorer will not check the digital signatures of executable programs or display their identities before downloading them to the user computers. |
| V-46635 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some UNC paths could refer to servers not managed by the organization, which means they could host malicious content; and therefore, it is safest to not include all UNC paths in the Intranet Sites zone. This policy setting controls whether URLs representing UNCs are mapped into the local Intranet security zone. If you enable this policy setting, all network paths are mapped into the Intranet Zone. If you disable this policy setting, network paths are not necessarily mapped into the Intranet Zone (other rules might map one there). If you do not configure this policy setting, users choose whether network paths are mapped into the Intranet Zone. |
| V-46637 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage restrictions on script-initiated pop-up windows and windows including the title and status bars. If you enable this policy setting, Windows Restrictions security will not apply in this zone. The security zone runs without the added layer of security provided by this feature. If you disable this policy setting, the possible harmful actions contained in script-initiated pop-up windows and windows including the title and status bars cannot be run. This Internet Explorer security feature will be on in this zone as dictated by the Scripted Windows Security Restrictions feature control setting for the process. If you do not configure this policy setting, the possible harmful actions contained in script-initiated pop-up windows and windows including the title and status bars cannot be run.

| V-46641 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether scriptlets can be allowed. Scriptlets hosted on sites located in this zone are more likely to contain malicious code. If you enable this policy setting, users will be able to run scriptlets. If you disable this policy setting, users will not be able to run scriptlets. If you do not configure this policy setting, a scriptlet can be enabled or disabled by the user. |
| V-46643 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether users will be prompted for non user-initiated file downloads. Regardless of this setting, users will receive file download dialogs for user-initiated downloads. Users may accept downloads that they did not request, and those downloaded files may include malicious code. If you enable this setting, users will receive a file download dialog for automatic download attempts. If you disable or do not configure this setting, file downloads that are not user-initiated will be blocked, and users will see the information bar instead of the file download dialog. Users can then click the information bar to allow the file download prompt. |

| V-46727 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page it opens that are dependent upon the location of the web page (such as Internet Zone, Intranet Zone, or Local Machine Zone). Web pages on a local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine Zone, which makes the Local Machine Security Zone a prime target for malicious attackers. If you enable this policy setting, any zone can be protected from zone elevation by Internet Explorer processes. This approach stops content running in one zone from gaining the elevated privileges of another zone. If you disable this policy setting, no zone receives such protection from Internet Explorer processes. Because of the severity and relative frequency of zone elevation attacks, this guide recommends that you configure this setting as "Enabled" in all environments. |

If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose whether SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. |
| V-64721 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. If you enable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. If you disable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter does not scan pages in this zone for malicious content. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose whether SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. |
| V-64723 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls that are not marked safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. This setting causes both unsafe and safe controls to be initialized and scripted, ignoring the Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting option. This increases the risk of malicious code being loaded and executed by the browser. If you enable this policy setting, ActiveX controls are run, loaded with parameters and scripted without setting object safety for untrusted data or scripts. If you disable this policy setting, ActiveX controls that cannot be made safe are not loaded with parameters or scripted. This setting is not recommended, except for secure and administered zones. |

| V-64729 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This parameter ensures only DoD-approved ciphers and algorithms are enabled for use by the web browser by blocking an insecure fallback to SSL when TLS 1.0 or greater fails.  |
| V-72757 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This feature keeps ActiveX controls up to date and helps make them safer to use in Internet Explorer. Many ActiveX controls are not automatically updated as new versions are released. It is very important to keep ActiveX controls up to date because malicious or compromised webpages can target security flaws in out-of-date ActiveX controls. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-46473 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This parameter ensures only DoD-approved ciphers and algorithms are enabled for use by the web browser by allowing you to turn on/off support for TLS and SSL. TLS is a protocol for protecting communications between the browser and the target server. When the browser attempts to set up a protected communication with the target server, the browser and server negotiate which protocol and version to use. The browser and server attempt to match each other's list of supported protocols and versions and pick the most preferred match.. |
| V-46475 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This parameter warns users if the certificate being presented by the website is invalid. Since server certificates are used to validate the identity of the web server it is critical to warn the user of a potential issue with the certificate being presented by the web server. This setting aids to prevent spoofing attacks. |
| V-46477 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Check for publisher's certificate revocation options should be enforced to ensure all PKI signed objects are validated. |
| V-46481 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Active X controls can contain potentially malicious code and must only be allowed to be downloaded from trusted sites. Signed code is better than unsigned code in that it may be easier to determine its author, but it is still potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. This policy setting allows you to manage whether users may download signed ActiveX controls from a page in the zone. If you enable this policy, users can download signed controls without user intervention. If you select Prompt in the drop-down box, users are queried whether to download controls signed by untrusted publishers. Code signed by trusted publishers is silently downloaded. If you disable the policy setting, signed controls cannot be downloaded. |
| V-46483 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Unsigned code is potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. This policy setting allows you to manage whether users may download unsigned ActiveX controls from the zone. If you enable this policy setting, users can run unsigned controls without user intervention. If you select "Prompt" in the drop-down box, users are queried to choose whether to allow the unsigned control to run. If you disable this policy setting, users cannot run unsigned controls. If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot run unsigned controls. |
| V-46501 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls that are not marked safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. This setting causes both unsafe and safe controls to be initialized and scripted, ignoring the Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting option. This increases the risk of malicious code being loaded and executed by the browser. If you enable this policy setting, ActiveX controls are run, loaded with parameters and scripted without setting object safety for untrusted data or scripts. If you disable this policy setting, ActiveX controls that cannot be made safe are not loaded with parameters or scripted. This setting is not recommended, except for secure and administered zones. |
| V-46507 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code; sites located in this security zone are more likely to be hosted by malicious individuals. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually. Use of the Low Safety permission enables applets to perform all operations. Use of the Medium Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox (an area in memory outside of which the program cannot make calls), plus adds capabilities like scratch space (a safe and secure storage area on the client computer) and a user-controlled file I/O. Use of the High Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox. If you disable this policy setting, Java applets cannot run. If you do not configure this policy setting, the permission is set to High Safety. |
| V-46509 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The ability to access data zones across domains could cause the user to unknowingly access content hosted on an unauthorized server. Access to data sources across multiple domains must be controlled based upon the site being browsed. This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer can access data from another security zone using the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) or ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). |
| V-46511 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Content hosted on sites located in the Internet zone are likely to contain malicious payloads and therefore this feature should be blocked for this zone. Drag and drop or copy and paste files must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. |
| V-46513 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether applications may be run and files may be downloaded from an IFRAME reference in the HTML of the pages in this zone. Launching of programs in IFRAME must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. If you enable this policy setting, applications can run and files can be downloaded from IFRAMEs on the pages in this zone without user intervention. If you disable this setting, users are prevented from running applications and downloading files from IFRAMEs on the pages in this zone. |
| V-46515 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Frames that navigate across different domains are a security concern, because the user may think they are accessing pages on one site while they are actually accessing pages on another site. It is possible that a website hosting malicious content could use this feature in a manner similar to cross-site scripting (XSS). This policy setting allows you to manage the opening of sub-frames and access of applications across different domains. |
| V-46517 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Userdata persistence must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. It is possible for sites hosting malicious content to exploit this feature as part of an attack against visitors browsing the site. This policy setting allows you to manage the preservation of information in the browser's history, in Favorites, in an XML store, or directly within a web page saved to disk. When a user returns to a persisted page, the state of the page can be restored if this policy setting is not appropriately configured.  |
| V-46521 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A malicious script could use the clipboard in an undesirable manner, for example, if the user had recently copied confidential information to the clipboard while editing a document, a malicious script could harvest that information. It might be possible to exploit other vulnerabilities in order to send the harvested data to the attacker. Allow paste operations via script must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. |
| V-46523 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users could submit credentials to servers operated by malicious individuals who could then attempt to connect to legitimate servers with those captured credentials. Care must be taken with user credentials, automatic logon performance, and how default Windows credentials are passed to the websites. This policy setting allows management of settings for logon options. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from varying logon options. “Anonymous logon” disables HTTP authentication and uses the guest account only for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. “Prompt for user name and password” queries users for user IDs and passwords. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone” queries users for user IDs and passwords in other zones. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon with current user name and password” attempts logon using Windows NT Challenge Response. If Windows NT Challenge Response is supported by the server, the logon uses the user's network user name and password for login. If Windows NT Challenge Response is not supported by the server, the user is queried to provide the user name and password. If you disable this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”. If you do not configure this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”. The most secure option is to configure this setting to “Enabled”; “Anonymous logon”, but configuring this setting to “Enabled”; “Prompt for user name and password”, provides a reasonable balance between security and usability. |
| V-46525 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually.

Use of the Medium Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox (an area in memory outside of which the program cannot make calls), plus adds capabilities like scratch space (a safe and secure storage area on the client computer) and a user-controlled file I/O. Use of the High Safety permission enables applets to run in their sandbox. If you disable this policy setting, Java applets cannot run. If you do not configure this policy setting, the permission is set to High Safety. |
| V-46543 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually.

If you do not configure this policy setting, the permission is set to High Safety |
| V-46545 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to set options for dragging content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. If you enable this policy setting, users can drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. Users cannot change this setting. If you disable this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. Users cannot change this setting in the Internet Options dialog box. If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in the same window. Users can change this setting in the Internet Options dialog box. |
| V-46547 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to set options for dragging content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. If you enable this policy setting, users can drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. Users cannot change this setting. If you enable this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when both the source and destination are in different windows. Users cannot change this setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. Users can change this setting in the Internet Options dialog box. |
| V-46549 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users often choose to install software such as ActiveX controls that are not permitted by their organization's security policy. Such software can pose significant security and privacy risks to networks. This policy setting enables blocking of ActiveX control installation prompts for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will be blocked for Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will not be blocked and these prompts will be displayed to users. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user's preference will be used to determine whether to block ActiveX control installations for Internet Explorer processes. |

Signed code is better than unsigned code in that it may be easier to determine its author, but it is still potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. |
| V-46575 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Unsigned code is potentially harmful, especially when coming from an untrusted zone. ActiveX controls can contain potentially malicious code and must only be allowed to be downloaded from trusted sites. They must also be digitally signed. |
| V-46577 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. |
| V-46579 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether ActiveX controls and plug-ins can be run on pages from the specified zone. ActiveX controls not marked as safe should not be executed. If you enable this policy setting, controls and plug-ins can run without user intervention. If you disable this policy setting, controls and plug-ins are prevented from running. |
| V-46581 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows management of whether ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting can interact with a script. If you enable this policy setting, script interaction can occur automatically without user intervention. ActiveX controls not marked as safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. |
| V-46583 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Sites located in the Restricted Sites Zone are more likely to contain malicious payloads and therefore downloads from this zone should be blocked. Files should not be able to be downloaded from sites that are considered restricted. This policy setting allows you to manage whether file downloads are permitted from the zone. This option is determined by the zone of the page with the link causing the download, not the zone from which the file is delivered. |
| V-46587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Java applications could contain malicious code; sites located in this security zone are more likely to be hosted by malicious individuals. This policy setting allows you to manage permissions for Java applets. If you enable this policy setting, options can be chosen from the drop-down box. Use of the Custom permission will control permissions settings individually. Use of the Low Safety permission enables applets to perform all operations.

| V-46589 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The ability to access data zones across domains could cause the user to unknowingly access content hosted on an unauthorized server. This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer can access data from another security zone using the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) or ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). |
| V-46591 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | It is possible that users will unknowingly be redirected to a site hosting malicious content. 'Allow META REFRESH' must have a level of protection based upon the site being browsed. This policy setting allows you to manage whether a user's browser can be redirected to another web page if the author of the web page uses the Meta Refresh setting to redirect browsers to another web page. |
| V-46593 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Content hosted on sites located in the Restricted Sites zone are more likely to contain malicious payloads and therefore this feature should be blocked for this zone. Drag and drop or copy and paste files must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. |
| V-46597 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether applications may be run and files may be downloaded from an IFRAME reference in the HTML of the pages in this zone.

| V-46601 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Userdata persistence must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. This policy setting allows you to manage the preservation of information in the browser's history, in Favorites, in an XML store, or directly within a web page saved to disk. When a user returns to a persisted page, the state of the page can be restored if this policy setting is not appropriately configured. |
| V-46603 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Active scripts hosted on sites located in this zone are more likely to contain malicious code. Active scripting must have a level of protection based upon the site being accessed. This policy setting allows you to manage whether script code on pages in the zone are run. |
| V-46605 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A malicious script could use the clipboard in an undesirable manner, for example, if the user had recently copied confidential information to the clipboard while editing a document, a malicious script could harvest that information.

The most secure option is to configure this setting to “Enabled”; “Anonymous logon”. This will prevent users from submitting credentials to servers in this security zone. |
| V-46609.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The delete Browsing History option can be accessed using Tools, Internet Options, "General" tab, and then click Settings under Browsing History. If you enable this policy setting, a user cannot set the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List must be specified. Users will not be able to delete browsing history. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a user can set the number of days that Internet Explorer tracks views of pages in the History List. Users can delete browsing history. |
| V-46609.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The delete Browsing History option can be accessed using Tools, Internet Options, "General" tab, and then click Settings under Browsing History. If you enable this policy setting, a user cannot set the number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List. The number of days that Internet Explorer keeps track of the pages viewed in the History List must be specified. Users will not be able to delete browsing history. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a user can set the number of days that Internet Explorer tracks views of pages in the History List. Users can delete browsing history. |
| V-46615 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting prevents users from adding sites to various security zones. Users should not be able to add sites to different zones, as this could allow them to bypass security controls of the system. If you do not configure this policy setting, users will be able to add or remove sites from the Trusted Sites and Restricted Sites zones at will and change settings in the Local Intranet zone. This configuration could allow sites that host malicious mobile code to be added to these zones, and users could execute the code. |
| V-46617 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users who change their Internet Explorer security settings could enable the execution of dangerous types of code from the Internet and websites listed in the Restricted Sites zone in the browser. This setting prevents users from changing the Internet Explorer policies on the machine. Policy changes should be made by administrators only, so this setting should be enabled. If you enable this policy setting, you disable the "Custom level" button and "Security" level for this zone slider on the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, users will be able to change the settings for security zones. It prevents users from changing security zone policy settings that are established by the administrator. |
| V-46619 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users who change their Internet Explorer security settings could enable the execution of dangerous types of code from the Internet and websites listed in the Restricted Sites zone in the browser. This setting enforces consistent security zone settings to all users of the computer. Security zones control browser behavior at various websites and it is desirable to maintain a consistent policy for all users of a machine. This policy setting affects how security zone changes apply to different users. If you enable this policy setting, changes that one user makes to a security zone will apply to all users of that computer. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, users of the same computer are allowed to establish their own security zone settings. |
| V-46621 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting turns off the Security Settings Check feature, which checks Internet Explorer security settings to determine when the settings put Internet Explorer at risk. If you enable this policy setting, the security settings check will not be performed. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the security settings check will be performed. |
| V-46625 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls and file downloads often have digital signatures attached that certify the file's integrity and the identity of the signer (creator) of the software. Such signatures help ensure unmodified software is downloaded and the user can positively identify the signer to determine whether you trust them enough to run their software. |
| V-46629 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer will check revocation status of servers' certificates. Certificates are revoked when they have been compromised or are no longer valid, and this option protects users from submitting confidential data to a site that may be fraudulent or not secure. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will check to see if server certificates have been revoked. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not check server certificates to see if they have been revoked. If you do not configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not check server certificates to see if they have been revoked. |
| V-46633 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer checks for digital signatures (which identifies the publisher of signed software and verifies it has not been modified or tampered with) on user computers before downloading executable programs. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will check the digital signatures of executable programs and display their identities before downloading them to the user computers. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not check the digital signatures of executable programs or display their identities before downloading them to the user computers. If you do not configure this policy, Internet Explorer will not check the digital signatures of executable programs or display their identities before downloading them to the user computers. |
| V-46635 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some UNC paths could refer to servers not managed by the organization, which means they could host malicious content; and therefore, it is safest to not include all UNC paths in the Intranet Sites zone. This policy setting controls whether URLs representing UNCs are mapped into the local Intranet security zone. If you enable this policy setting, all network paths are mapped into the Intranet Zone. If you disable this policy setting, network paths are not necessarily mapped into the Intranet Zone (other rules might map one there). If you do not configure this policy setting, users choose whether network paths are mapped into the Intranet Zone. |
| V-46637 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage restrictions on script-initiated pop-up windows and windows including the title and status bars. If you enable this policy setting, Windows Restrictions security will not apply in this zone. The security zone runs without the added layer of security provided by this feature. If you disable this policy setting, the possible harmful actions contained in script-initiated pop-up windows and windows including the title and status bars cannot be run. This Internet Explorer security feature will be on in this zone as dictated by the Scripted Windows Security Restrictions feature control setting for the process. If you do not configure this policy setting, the possible harmful actions contained in script-initiated pop-up windows and windows including the title and status bars cannot be run. This Internet Explorer security feature will be on in this zone as dictated by the Scripted Windows Security Restrictions feature control setting for the process. |
| V-46639 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage restrictions on script-initiated pop-up windows and windows including the title and status bars. If you enable this policy setting, Windows Restrictions security will not apply in this zone. The security zone runs without the added layer of security provided by this feature.

The InPrivate Browsing feature in Internet Explorer makes browser privacy easy by not storing history, cookies, temporary Internet files, or other data. If you enable this policy setting, InPrivate Browsing will be disabled. If you disable this policy setting, InPrivate Browsing will be available for use. If you do not configure this setting, InPrivate Browsing can be turned on or off through the registry. |
| V-46849 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether a page may control embedded WebBrowser control via script. Scripted code hosted on sites located in this zone is more likely to contain malicious code. If you enable this policy setting, script access to the WebBrowser control is allowed. If you disable this policy setting, script access to the WebBrowser control is not allowed. If you do not configure this policy setting, script access to the WebBrowser control can be enabled or disabled by the user. By default, script access to the WebBrowser control is only allowed in the Local Machine and Intranet Zones. |
| V-46853 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether or not the local path information will be sent when uploading a file via a HTML form. If the local path information is sent, some information may be unintentionally revealed to the server. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose whether path information will be sent when uploading a file via a form. By default, path information will be sent. |
| V-46857 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Notification Bar is displayed for Internet Explorer processes when file or code installs are restricted. By default, the Notification Bar is displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, the Notification Bar will be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, the Notification Bar will not be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you do not configure this policy setting, the Notification Bar will be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. |
| V-46859 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether or not the 'Open File - Security Warning' message appears when the user tries to open executable files or other potentially unsafe files (from an intranet file shared by using Windows Explorer, for example). If you enable this policy setting and set the drop-down box to "Enable", these files open without a security warning. If you set the drop-down box to " Prompt", a security warning appears before the files open. If you disable this policy these files do not open. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can configure how the computer handles these files. |
| V-46861 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Notification Bar is displayed for Internet Explorer processes when file or code installs are restricted. By default, the Notification Bar is displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, the Notification Bar will be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, the Notification Bar will not be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you do not configure this policy setting, the Notification Bar will be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. |
| V-46865 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether or not the user is prompted to allow ActiveX controls to run on websites other than the website that installed the ActiveX control. If the user were to disable the setting for the zone, malicious ActiveX controls could be executed without the user's knowledge. Disabling this setting would allow the possibility for malicious ActiveX controls to be executed from non-approved domains within this zone without the user's knowledge. Enabling this setting enforces the default value and prohibits the user from changing the value. Websites should be moved into another zone if permissions need to be changed. |
| V-46869 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Notification Bar is displayed for Internet Explorer processes when file or code installs are restricted. By default, the Notification Bar is displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, the Notification Bar will be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, the Notification Bar will not be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. If you do not configure this policy setting, the Notification Bar will be displayed for Internet Explorer processes. |
| V-46879 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Cross-Site Scripting Filter is designed to prevent users from becoming victims of unintentional information disclosure. This setting controls if the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Filter detects and prevents cross-site script injection into websites in this zone. If you enable this policy setting, the XSS Filter will be enabled for sites in this zone, and the XSS Filter will attempt to block cross-site script injections. If you disable this policy setting, the XSS Filter will be disabled for sites in this zone, and Internet Explorer will permit cross-site script injections. |
| V-46883 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether a page may control embedded WebBrowser Control via script. Scripted code hosted on sites located in this zone is more likely to contain malicious code. If you enable this policy setting, script access to the WebBrowser Control is allowed. If you disable this policy setting, script access to the WebBrowser Control is not allowed. If you do not configure this policy setting, script access to the WebBrowser Control can be enabled or disabled by the user. By default, script access to the WebBrowser Control is only allowed in the Local Machine and Intranet Zones. |
| V-46885 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether or not the local path information will be sent when uploading a file via a HTML form. If the local path information is sent, some information may be unintentionally revealed to the server. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose whether path information will be sent when uploading a file via a form. By default, path information will be sent. |
| V-46889 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether or not the 'Open File - Security Warning' message appears when the user tries to open executable files or other potentially unsafe files (from an intranet file shared by using Windows Explorer, for example). If you enable this policy setting and set the drop-down box to "Enable", these files open without a security warning. If you set the drop-down box to "Prompt", a security warning appears before the files open. If you disable this policy these files do not open. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can configure how the computer handles these files. |
| V-46893 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether or not the user is prompted to allow ActiveX controls to run on websites other than the website that installed the ActiveX control. If the user were to disable the setting for the zone, malicious ActiveX controls could be executed without the user's knowledge. Disabling this setting would allow the possibility for malicious ActiveX controls to be executed from non-approved domains within this zone without the user's knowledge. Enabling this setting enforces the default value and prohibits the user from changing the value. Websites should be moved into another zone if permissions need to be changed. |
| V-46895 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Cross-Site Scripting Filter is designed to prevent users from becoming victims of unintentional information disclosure. This setting controls if the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Filter detects and prevents cross-site script injection into websites in this zone. If you enable this policy setting, the XSS Filter will be enabled for sites in this zone, and the XSS Filter will attempt to block cross-site script injections. If you disable this policy setting, the XSS Filter will be disabled for sites in this zone, and Internet Explorer will permit cross-site script injections. |
| V-46897 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users often choose to install software such as ActiveX controls that are not permitted by their organization's security policy. Such software can pose significant security and privacy risks to networks. This policy setting enables blocking of ActiveX control installation prompts for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will be blocked for Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will not be blocked and these prompts will be displayed to users. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user's preference will be used to determine whether to block ActiveX control installations for Internet Explorer processes. |
| V-46903 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether script is allowed to update the status bar within the zone. A script running in the zone could cause false information to be displayed on the status bar, which could confuse the user and cause them to perform an undesirable action. If you enable this policy setting, script is allowed to update the status bar. If you disable this policy setting, script is not allowed to update the status bar. If you do not configure this policy setting, status bar updates via scripts will be disabled. |
| V-46907 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Unsigned components are more likely to contain malicious code and it is more difficult to determine the author of the application - therefore they should be avoided if possible. This policy setting allows you to manage whether .NET Framework components that are not signed with Authenticode can be executed from Internet Explorer. These components include managed controls referenced from an object tag and managed executables referenced from a link. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will execute unsigned managed components. If you select "Prompt" in the drop-down box, Internet Explorer will prompt the user to determine whether to execute unsigned managed components. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not execute unsigned managed components. If you do not configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not execute unsigned managed components. |
| V-46921 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | It may be possible for someone to host malicious content on a website that takes advantage of these components. This policy setting allows you to manage whether .NET Framework components that are signed with Authenticode can be executed from Internet Explorer. These components include managed controls referenced from an object tag and managed executables referenced from a link. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will execute signed managed components. If you select "Prompt" in the drop-down box, Internet Explorer will prompt the user to determine whether to execute signed managed components. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not execute signed managed components. If you do not configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not execute signed managed components. |
| V-46927 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether scriptlets can be allowed. Scriptlets hosted on sites located in this zone are more likely to contain malicious code. If you enable this policy setting, users will be able to run scriptlets. If you disable this policy setting, users will not be able to run scriptlets. If you do not configure this policy setting, a scriptlet can be enabled or disabled by the user. |
| V-46939 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A script running in the zone could cause false information to be displayed on the status bar, which could confuse the user and cause an undesirable action. This policy setting allows you to manage whether script is allowed to update the status bar within the zone. If you enable this policy setting, script is allowed to update the status bar. If you disable this policy setting, script is not allowed to update the status bar. If you do not configure this policy setting, status bar updates via scripts will be disabled. |
| V-46975 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting prevents ActiveX controls from running in Protected Mode when Enhanced Protected Mode is enabled. When a user has an ActiveX control installed that is not compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode and a website attempts to load the control, Internet Explorer notifies the user and gives the option to run the website in regular Protected Mode. This policy setting disables this notification and forces all websites to run in Enhanced Protected Mode. Enhanced Protected Mode provides additional protection against malicious websites by using 64-bit processes on 64-bit versions of Windows. For computers running at least Windows 8, Enhanced Protected Mode also limits the locations Internet Explorer can read from in the registry and the file system. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not give the user the option to disable Enhanced Protected Mode. All Protected Mode websites will run in Enhanced Protected Mode. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer notifies users and provides an option to run websites with incompatible ActiveX controls in regular Protected Mode. |
| V-46981 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to set options for dragging content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. If you enable this policy setting, users can drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. Users cannot change this setting. If you disable this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when both the source and destination are in different windows. Users cannot change this setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot drag content from one domain to a different domain when the source and destination are in different windows. Users can change this setting in the Internet Options dialog box. |
| V-46987 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enhanced Protected Mode provides additional protection against malicious websites by using 64-bit processes on 64-bit versions of Windows. For computers running at least Windows 8, Enhanced Protected Mode also limits the locations Internet Explorer can read from in the registry and the file system. If you enable this policy setting, Enhanced Protected Mode will be turned on. Any zone that has Protected Mode enabled will use Enhanced Protected Mode. Users will not be able to disable Enhanced Protected Mode. If you disable this policy setting, Enhanced Protected Mode will be turned off. Any zone that has Protected Mode enabled will use the version of Protected Mode introduced in Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Vista. If you do not configure this policy, users will be able to turn on or turn off Enhanced Protected Mode on the "Advanced" tab of the Internet Options dialog box. |
| V-46995 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer 11 uses 64-bit processes (for greater security) or 32-bit processes (for greater compatibility) when running in Enhanced Protected Mode on 64-bit versions of Windows.Important: Some ActiveX controls and toolbars may not be available when 64-bit processes are used. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer 11 will use 64-bit tab processes when running in Enhanced Protected Mode on 64-bit versions of Windows. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer 11 will use 32-bit tab processes when running in Enhanced Protected Mode on 64-bit versions of Windows. If you don't configure this policy setting, users can turn this feature on or off using Internet Explorer settings. This feature is turned off by default. |
| V-46997 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer runs Anti-Malware programs against ActiveX controls, to check if they're safe to load on pages. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer won't check with your Anti-Malware program to see if it's safe to create an instance of the ActiveX control. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer always checks with your Anti-Malware program to see if it's safe to create an instance of the ActiveX control. If you don't configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer always checks with your Anti-Malware program to see if it's safe to create an instance of the ActiveX control. Users can turn this behavior on or off, using Internet Explorer Security settings. |
| V-46999 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer runs Anti-Malware programs against ActiveX controls, to check if they're safe to load on pages. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer won't check with your Anti-Malware program to see if it's safe to create an instance of the ActiveX control. If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer always checks with your Anti-Malware program to see if it's safe to create an instance of the ActiveX control.

Users can turn this behavior on or off, using Internet Explorer Security settings. |
| V-64711 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether the user can bypass warnings from SmartScreen Filter. SmartScreen Filter prevents the user from browsing to or downloading from sites that are known to host malicious content. SmartScreen Filter also prevents the execution of files that are known to be malicious. If you enable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter warnings block the user. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can bypass SmartScreen Filter warnings. |
| V-64713 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether the user can bypass warnings from SmartScreen Filter. SmartScreen Filter warns the user about executable files that Internet Explorer users do not commonly download from the internet. If you enable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter warnings block the user. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can bypass SmartScreen Filter warnings. |
| V-64715 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to prevent the installation of ActiveX controls on a per-user basis. If you enable this policy setting, ActiveX controls cannot be installed on a per-user basis. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, ActiveX controls can be installed on a per-user basis. |
| V-64717 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting prevents the user from ignoring Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificate errors that interrupt browsing (such as “expired”, “revoked”, or “name mismatch” errors) in Internet Explorer. If you enable this policy setting, the user cannot continue browsing. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose to ignore certificate errors and continue browsing. |
| V-64719 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. If you enable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. If you disable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter does not scan pages in this zone for malicious content. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose whether SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. |
| V-64721 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. If you enable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. If you disable this policy setting, SmartScreen Filter does not scan pages in this zone for malicious content. If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose whether SmartScreen Filter scans pages in this zone for malicious content. |
| V-64723 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls that are not marked safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed. This setting causes both unsafe and safe controls to be initialized and scripted, ignoring the Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting option. This increases the risk of malicious code being loaded and executed by the browser. If you enable this policy setting, ActiveX controls are run, loaded with parameters and scripted without setting object safety for untrusted data or scripts. If you disable this policy setting, ActiveX controls that cannot be made safe are not loaded with parameters or scripted. This setting is not recommended, except for secure and administered zones. |
| V-64725 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls that are not marked safe for scripting should not be executed. Although this is not a complete security measure for a control to be marked safe for scripting, if a control is not marked safe, it should not be initialized and executed.

This increases the risk of malicious code being loaded and executed by the browser. If you enable this policy setting, ActiveX controls are run, loaded with parameters and scripted without setting object safety for untrusted data or scripts. If you disable this policy setting, ActiveX controls that cannot be made safe are not loaded with parameters or scripted. This setting is not recommended, except for secure and administered zones. |
| V-64729 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This parameter ensures only DoD-approved ciphers and algorithms are enabled for use by the web browser by blocking an insecure fallback to SSL when TLS 1.0 or greater fails.  |
| V-72757 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This feature keeps ActiveX controls up to date and helps make them safer to use in Internet Explorer. Many ActiveX controls are not automatically updated as new versions are released. It is very important to keep ActiveX controls up to date because malicious or compromised webpages can target security flaws in out-of-date ActiveX controls. |

| V-72761 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether users can run the Tabular Data Control (TDC) ActiveX control, based on security zone. By default, the TDC ActiveX Control is disabled in the Internet and Restricted Sites security zones. If you enable this policy setting, users will not be able to run the TDC ActiveX control from all sites in the specified zone. |
| V-72763 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether users can run the Tabular Data Control (TDC) ActiveX control, based on security zone. By default, the TDC ActiveX Control is disabled in the Internet and Restricted Sites security zones. If you enable this policy setting, users won’t be able to run the TDC ActiveX control from all sites in the specified zone. |
| V-75169 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows the management of whether VBScript can be run on pages from the specified zone in Internet Explorer. By selecting "Enable" in the drop-down box, VBScript can run without user intervention. By selecting "Prompt" in the drop-down box, users are asked to choose whether to allow VBScript to run. By selecting "Disable" in the drop-down box, VBScript is prevented from running. If this policy setting is not configured or disabled, VBScript will run without user intervention. |
| V-75171 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows the management of whether VBScript can be run on pages from the specified zone in Internet Explorer.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-17173 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous web pages, which could pose a security risk. |
| V-17174 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a Web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-17175 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run. |
| V-17183 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a Web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur. |
| V-17184 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Pop-up Blocker" feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk. |
| V-17187 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an application is configured to require all add-ins to be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message informing users about the unsigned add-in. If a user is allowed to make the determination to allow an unsigned add-in, it increases the risk of malicious code being introduced onto the user's computer or the network. |
| V-17322 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | By default, users are prompted to update automatic links. |
| V-17471 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Trusted locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures and could harm users' computers or data. By default, files located in trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) are assumed to be safe. |
| V-17473 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When an Office Open XML document (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) is rights-managed, or password-protected, any macros embedded in the document are encrypted along with the rest of the contents. By default, these encrypted macros will be disabled unless they are scanned by antivirus software immediately before being loaded. If this default configuration is modified, Office products will not require encrypted macros to be scanned before loading. They will be handled as specified by the Office System macro security settings, which can cause macro viruses to load undetected and lead to data loss or reduced application functionality. |
| V-17520 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Files located in trusted locations and specified in the Trust Center are typically assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. By default, users can specify "Trusted Locations" on network shares, or in other remote locations not under their direct control, by selecting the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network" (not recommended) check box in the "Trusted Locations" section of the Trust Center. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to typical security measures and could affect users' computers or data. |
| V-17521 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users create new Excel files, Excel 2013 saves them in the new *.xlsx format. Ensure this setting is enabled to specify all new files are created in Excel 2013. If a new file is created in an earlier format, some users may not be able to open or use the file, or they may choose a format that is less secure than the Excel 2013 format. Users can still select a specific format when they save files, but they cannot change the default of this setting from the "Excel Options" dialog box. This enforced user behavior ensures any change to the file format requires additional deliberate user interaction. |
| V-17522 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | STO projects require access to the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, even though the projects do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Design-time support of controls in both Visual Basic and C# projects depends on the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Word and Excel. By default, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint do not allow automation clients to have programmatic access to VBA projects. Users can enable this by selecting the Trust access to the VBA project object model in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. However, doing so allows macros in any documents the user opens to access the core Visual Basic objects, methods, and properties, which represents a potential security hazard. |
| V-17545 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users open files containing VBA macros, applications open the files with the macros disabled and displays the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users may then enable these macros by clicking "Options" on the Trust Bar and selecting the option to enable them. Disabling or not configuring this setting may allow dangerous macros to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-17621 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Excel can load files with extensions that do not match the files' type. For example, if a comma-separated values (CSV) file named example.csv is renamed example.xls, Excel can properly load it as a CSV file. Some attacks target specific file formats. If Excel is allowed to load files with extensions that do not match their file types, a malicious individual can deceive users into loading dangerous files that have incorrect extensions. By default, if users attempt to open files with the wrong extension, Excel opens the file and displays a warning that the file type is not what Excel expected. |
| V-17650 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users type a string of characters, Excel recognizes as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) path to a resource on the Internet or a local network, Excel will transform it into a hyperlink. Clicking the hyperlink opens it in the configured default web browser or the appropriate application. This functionality can enable users to accidentally create links to dangerous or restricted resources, which could create a security risk. |
| V-17652 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If users choose to publish Excel data to a static web page and enable the AutoRepublish feature, Excel saves a copy of the data to the web page every time the user saves the workbook. If the page is on a web server, anyone who has access to the page will be able to see the updated data after every save, which can lead to the undesired disclosure of sensitive or incorrect information. By default, a message dialog box displays every time the user saves a published workbook when AutoRepublish is enabled. From this dialog box, the user can disable AutoRepublish temporarily or permanently, or select "Do not show this message again" to prevent the dialog box from appearing after every save. If the user selects "Do not show this message again", Excel will continue to automatically republish the data after every save without informing the user. |
| V-17732 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an Excel workbook contains links to other documents and users are not prompted to approve them, the contents of the workbook might change without the users' knowledge because the linked files have changed. This has the risk of introducing corrupt or malicious content into the document. Prompting the user to update links will allow the content to be updated only with the user's knowledge.  |
| V-17744 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | AutoRepublish is a feature in Excel allowing workbooks to be automatically republished to the World Wide Web each time the workbook is saved. A number of changes might need to be made to allow the workbook to be successfully published, including the following: * External references are converted to values. * Hidden formulas become visible. * The "Set precision as displayed" option, which appears beneath the "When calculating this workbook" heading in the "Advanced" section of the "Excel Options" dialog box, is no longer available. These types of changes can mean the version on the web page might not be the same as the Excel file. By default, a message dialog box appears every time the user saves a published workbook when AutoRepublish is enabled. From this dialog box, the user can disable AutoRepublish temporarily or permanently, or select "Do not show this message again" to prevent the dialog box from appearing after every save. If the user selects "Do not show this message again", Excel will continue to automatically republish the data after every save without informing the user. |
| V-17751 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users open web pages in Excel, Excel loads any graphics included in the pages, regardless of whether or not they were originally created in Excel. Allowing Excel to load graphics created in other programs can make Excel vulnerable to possible future zero-day attacks using graphic files as an attack vector. If such an event occurs, this setting can be used to mitigate the vulnerability. |
| V-17804 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Record Macro dialog box includes a drop-down menu allowing users to choose whether to store the new macro in the current workbook, a new workbook, or their personal macro workbook (Personal.xlsb), a hidden workbook that opens every time Excel starts. By default, Excel displays the Record Macro dialog box with "This Workbook already selected" in the drop-down menu. If a user saves a macro in the active workbook and then distributes the workbook to others, the macro is distributed along with the workbook, which could put workbook data at risk if the macro is triggered accidentally or intentionally. |
| V-26584 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers. |
| V-26585 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26586 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26588 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-26589 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office 2013 applications do not, by default, check the digital signature on application add-ins before opening them. Disabling or not configuring this setting may allow an application to load a dangerous add-in. As a result, malicious code could become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26592 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office File Validation helps detect and prevent a kind of exploit known as a file format attack or file fuzzing attack. File format attacks exploit the integrity of a file. They occur when someone modifies the structure of a file with the intent of adding malicious code. Usually the malicious code is run remotely and is used to elevate the privilege of restricted accounts on the computer. As a result, an attacker could gain access to a computer that they did not previously have access to. This could enable an attacker to read sensitive information from the computer's hard disk drive or install malware, such as a worm or a key logging program. The Office File Validation feature helps prevent file format attacks by scanning and validating files before they are opened. To validate files, Office File Validation compares a file's structure to a predefined file schema, which is a set of rules that determine what a readable file looks like. If Office File Validation detects that a file's structure does not follow all rules that are described in the schema, the file does not pass validation. |
| V-26595 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur during between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26596 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format.

| V-26599 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26601 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26607 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26608 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26609 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26610 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26611 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26612 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can open, view, or edit a large number of file types in Office 2013. Some file types are safer than others, as some could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. For this reason, disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26613 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining whether users can open, view, edit, or save Excel files with the format specified by the title |
| V-26614 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining if files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. |
| V-26615 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether files located in unsafe locations will open in Protected View. If unsafe locations have not been specified, only the "Downloaded Program Files" and "Temporary Internet Files" folders are considered unsafe locations. If enabling this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations open in Protected View. |
| V-26616.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy key controls how Office documents should be handled when failing file validation. By requiring such documents to be opened in Protected View, any potentially malicious code would be disabled, allowing the user to edit the document and resave correctly. |
| V-26616.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy key controls how Office documents should be handled when failing file validation. By requiring such documents to be opened in Protected View, any potentially malicious code would be disabled, allowing the user to edit the document and resave correctly. |
| V-26617 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining whether Excel files in Outlook attachments open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, Outlook attachments do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, Outlook attachments open in Protected View. |
| V-41344 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The WEBSERVICE function option, when used in an Excel spreadsheet, returns data from a web service on the Internet or Intranet. If allowed to be used, security is significantly reduced by allowing information disclosure to third party web services and could potentially introduce malicious content to the local network. The WEBSERVICE function must be disabled in Excel and configured to notify user if a WEBSERVICE function is present in an Excel spreadsheet. |
| V-41346 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls whether Excel presents users with a list of data extraction options before beginning an Open and Repair operation when users choose to open a corrupt workbook in repair or extract mode. A corrupt Excel file may be indicative of malicious tampering. By allowing the automatic handling of corrupt spreadsheets, malicious code may be introduced to the user's computer and the network. |
| V-72831 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to block macros from running in Office files that come from the Internet. If you enable this policy setting, macros are blocked from running, even if "Enable all macros" is selected in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. Also, instead of having the choice to "Enable Content", users will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. If the Office file is saved to a trusted location or was previously trusted by the user, macros will be allowed to run. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the settings configured in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center determine whether macros run in Office files that come from the Internet.  |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-70955 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a website). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous Web pages, which could pose a security risk. |
| V-70957 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine whether users can open, view, edit, or save Excel files with the format specified by the title of this policy setting.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the file type will not be blocked.  |
| V-70967 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine if users can open, view, or edit Excel files. If you enable this policy setting, you can set one of these options:- Blocked files are not opened- Blocked files open in Protected View and can not be edited- Blocked files open in Protected View and can be edited. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the same as the "Blocked files are not opened" setting. Users will not be able to open blocked files.  |
| V-70969 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-70971 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine whether users can open, view, edit, or save Excel files with the format specified by the title of this policy setting.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the file type will be blocked.  |
| V-70981 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run.  |
| V-70983 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to turn off the file validation feature. If you enable this policy setting, file validation will be turned off. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, file validation will be turned on. Office Binary Documents (97-2003) are checked to see if they conform against the file format schema before they are opened.  |
| V-70985 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine whether users can open, view, edit, or save Excel files with the format specified by the title of this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify whether users can open, view, edit, or save files. The options that can be selected are below. Note: Not all options may be available for this policy setting.- Do not block: The file type will not be blocked.- Save blocked: Saving of the file type will be blocked.- Open/Save blocked, use open policy: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked. The file will open based on the policy setting configured in the "default file block behavior" key.- Block: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked, and the file will not open.- Open in Protected View: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked, and the option to edit the file type will not be enabled.- Allow editing and open in Protected View: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked, and the option to edit will be enabled. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the file type will not be blocked.  |
| V-70987 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine if files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. If you enable this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone do not open in Protected View. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View.  |
| V-70989 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine whether users can open, view, edit, or save Excel files with the format specified by the title of this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify whether users can open, view, edit, or save files. The options that can be selected are below. Note: Not all options may be available for this policy setting.- Do not block: The file type will not be blocked.- Save blocked: Saving of the file type will be blocked.- Open/Save blocked, use open policy: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked. The file will open based on the policy setting configured in the "default file block behavior" key.- Block: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked, and the file will not open.- Open in Protected View: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked, and the option to edit the file type will not be enabled.- Allow editing and open in Protected View: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked, and the option to edit will be enabled. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the file type will not be blocked.  |
| V-70991 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur.  |
| V-70993 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-70995 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers.  |
| V-70997 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether add-ins for the specified Office 2016 applications must be digitally signed by a trusted publisher. If you enable this policy setting, this application checks the digital signature for each add-in before loading it. If an add-in does not have a digital signature, or if the signature did not come from a trusted publisher, this application disables the add-in and notifies the user. Certificates must be added to the Trusted Publishers list if you require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher. For detail on about obtaining and distributing certificates, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294922. Office 2016 stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Office 2016 still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Office and you upgrade to Office 2016, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. For more information about trusted publishers, see the Office Resource Kit. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Office 2016 applications do not check the digital signature on application add-ins before opening them. If a dangerous add-in is loaded, it could harm users' computers or compromise data security.  |
| V-70999 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk.  |
| V-71001 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the specified Office 2016 applications notify users when unsigned application add-ins are loaded or silently disable such add-ins without notification. This policy setting only applies if you enable the ''Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher'' policy setting, which prevents users from changing this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, applications automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users. If you disable this policy setting, if an application is configured to require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message that informs users about the unsigned add-in. If you do not configure this policy setting, the disable behavior applies, and in addition, users can configure this requirement themselves in the ''Add-ins'' category of the Trust Center for the application.  |
| V-71003 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71005 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows administrators to disable all trusted locations in the specified applications. Trusted locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations that are assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures and could harm users' computers or data. If you enable this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are ignored, including any trusted locations established by Office 2016 during setup, deployed to users using Group Policy, or added by users themselves. Users will be prompted again when opening files from trusted locations. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are assumed to be safe.  |
| V-71007 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the "Add new location" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers. Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center. We recommended that you do not enable this policy setting (as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box also states). Therefore, in practice, it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users. If you do not enable this policy setting, users can select the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box if desired and then specify trusted locations by clicking the "Add new location" button.  |
| V-71011 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls the default file format for saving workbooks in Excel. If you enable this policy setting, you can set the default file format for Excel from among the following options:- Excel Workbook (.xlsx). This option is the default configuration in Excel 2016.- Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (.xlsm)- Excel Binary Workbook (.xlsb)- Web Page (.htm; .html)- Excel 97-2003 Workbook (.xls)- Excel 5.0/95 Workbook (.xls)- OpenDocument Spreadsheet (*.ods). Users can choose to save workbooks in a different file format than the default. If you disable or you do not configure this policy setting, Excel saves new workbooks in the Office Open XML format with an .xlsx extension.  |
| V-71015 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether encrypted macros in Open XML workbooks be are required to be scanned with anti-virus software before being opened. If you enable this policy setting, you may choose one of these options:- Scan encrypted macros: encrypted macros are disabled unless anti-virus software is installed. Encrypted macros are scanned by your anti-virus software when you attempt to open an encrypted workbook that contains macros.- Scan if anti-virus software available: if anti-virus software is installed, scan the encrypted macros first before allowing them to load. If anti-virus software is not available, allow encrypted macros to load.- Load macros without scanning: do not check for anti-virus software and allow macros to be loaded in an encrypted file. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior will be similar to the "Scan encrypted macros" option.  |
| V-71017 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls the default location for storing macros in Excel. If this policy setting is enabled, Excel stores macros in users' personal macro workbook. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Excel stores macros in the active workbook from which they are created. Note: In the user interface (UI), the "Store macro in" drop down list box in the Record Macro dialog box (Macros | Record Macro) allows users to choose whether to store the new macro in the current workbook, a new workbook, or their personal macro workbook (Personal.xlsb), a hidden workbook that opens every time Excel starts. By default, Excel displays the "Store macro in" box with "This Workbook" already selected in the drop-down list. If a user saves a macro in the active workbook and then distributes the workbook to others, the macro is distributed along with the workbook. If you enable this policy setting, Excel displays the "Store macro in" box with "Personal Macro Workbook" already selected. Users can still select one of the other two options in the drop-down menu.  |
| V-71019 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether automation clients such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Microsoft Office (VSTO) can access the Visual Basic for Applications project system in the specified applications. VSTO projects require access to the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, even though the projects do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Design-time support of controls in both Visual Basic and C# projects depends on the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Word and Excel. If you enable this policy setting, VSTO and other automation clients can access the Visual Basic for Applications project system in the specified applications. Users will not be able to change this behavior through the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" user interface option under the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. If you disable this policy setting, VSTO does not have programmatic access to VBA projects. In addition, the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" check box is cleared and users cannot change it. Note: Disabling this policy setting prevents VSTO projects from interacting properly with the VBA project system in the selected application. If you do not configure this policy setting, automation clients do not have programmatic access to VBA projects. Users can enable this by selecting the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" in the "Macro Settings" section of the Trust Center. However, doing so allows macros in any documents the user opens to access the core Visual Basic objects, methods, and properties, which represents a potential security hazard.  |
| V-71023 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71025 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations, and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71027 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting lets you determine if files located in unsafe locations will open in Protected View. If you have not specified unsafe locations, only the "Downloaded Program Files" and "Temporary Internet Files" folders are considered unsafe locations. If you enable this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations do not open in Protected View. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations open in Protected View.  |
| V-71029.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Office handles documents when they fail file validation. If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the following options for files that fail file validation:- Block files completely. Users cannot open the files.- Open files in Protected View and disallow edit. Users cannot edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you disable this policy setting.- Open files in Protected View and allow edit. Users can edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you do not configure this policy setting.If you disable this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and disallow edit" behavior. If you do not configure this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and allow edit" behavior.  |
| V-71029.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Office handles documents when they fail file validation. If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the following options for files that fail file validation:- Block files completely. Users cannot open the files.- Open files in Protected View and disallow edit. Users cannot edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you disable this policy setting.- Open files in Protected View and allow edit. Users can edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you do not configure this policy setting.If you disable this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and disallow edit" behavior. If you do not configure this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and allow edit" behavior.  |
| V-71031 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine if Excel files in Outlook attachments open in Protected View. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook attachments do not open in Protected View. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook attachments open in Protected View.  |
| V-71033 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. If you disable this policy setting, "Disable all with notification" will be the default setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar. If the user clicks "Enable Content", then the document is added as a trusted document. Important: If "Disable all except digitally signed macros" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases. Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Microsoft Office and you upgrade to Office, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store.  |
| V-71035 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Excel will warn users when WEBSERVICE functions are present. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about WEBSERVICE functions:- Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all WEBSERVICE functions. This option enforces the default configuration in Office.- Disable all without notification: The application disables all WEBSERVICE functions and does not notify users.- Enable all WEBSERVICE functions (not recommended): The application enables all WEBSERVICE functions and does not notify users. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing information disclosure to third party web services. If you disable this policy setting, the 'Disable all with notification' will be the default setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open workbooks that contain WEBSERVICE functions, Excel will open the files with the WEBSERVICE functions disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that WEBSERVICE functions are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar. If the user clicks "Enable Content," then the document is added as a trusted document.  |
| V-71037 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Excel presents users with a list of data extraction options before beginning an Open and Repair operation when users choose to open a corrupt workbook in repair or extract mode. If you enable this policy setting, Excel opens the file using the Safe Load process and does not prompt users to choose between repairing or extracting data. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Excel prompts the user to select either to repair or to extract data, and to select either to convert to values or to recover formulas.  |
| V-71039 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to block macros from running in Office files that come from the Internet. If you enable this policy setting, macros are blocked from running, even if 'Enable all macro's is selected in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. Also, instead of having the choice to 'Enable Content', users will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. If the Office file is saved to a trusted location or was previously trusted by the user, macros will be allowed to run. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the settings configured in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center determine whether macros run in Office files that come from the Internet.  |
| V-71639 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting lets you determine if files on local Intranet UNC file shares open in Protected View. If you enable this policy setting, files on local Intranet UNC file shares open in Protected View if their UNC paths appear to be within the Internet zone. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, files on Intranet UNC file shares do not open in Protected View if their UNC paths appear to be within the Internet zone. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-17173 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous web pages, which would pose a security risk. |
| V-17174 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-17175 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run. |
| V-17183 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur. |
| V-17184 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk. |
| V-17470 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | By default, Outlook automatically downloads content from sites that are considered "safe," as defined in the Security tab of the Internet Options dialog box in Internet Explorer. This configuration could allow users to inadvertently download Web beacons that reveal their identity to spammers and other malicious people. |
| V-17546 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to the Microsoft Office Online Calendar Sharing Services and to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. Office Online allows users to choose whether to restrict access to their calendars to people they invite, or allow unrestricted access to anyone who knows the URL to reach the calendar. DAV access restrictions can only be achieved through server and folder permissions, and might require the assistance of a server administrator to set up and maintain. If a calendar is visible to anyone on Office Online or third-party DAV servers, sensitive calendar information might be revealed. |
| V-17558 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users could send email messages to request that they be taken off a mailing list. If the email recipient is then automatically added to the Safe Senders List, future e mail messages from that address will no longer be sent to the users Junk email folder, even if it would otherwise be considered junk. By default, recipients of outgoing messages are not added automatically to individual users' Safe Senders Lists. However, users can change this configuration in the Outlook user interface. |
| V-17559 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Third-party ActiveX controls are not allowed to run in one-off forms in Outlook. This behavior can be changed so that Safe Controls (Microsoft Forms 2.0 controls and the Outlook Recipient and Body controls) are allowed in one-off forms, or so that all ActiveX controls are allowed to run. |
| V-17562 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious code can be included within Outlook forms, and such code could be executed when users open the form. By default, Outlook does not run scripts in forms in which the script and the layout are contained within the message. |
| V-17564 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious users can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether specific recipients open the message. Viewing an email message that contains a Web beacon provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. To reduce the risk from Web beacons, Outlook disables external content in email messages by default, unless the content is considered "safe" as determined by the check boxes in the Automatic Download section of the Trust Center. Depending on how these options are configured, safe content can include content in messages from addresses defined in the Safe Senders and Safe Recipients Lists used by the Junk email filter, content from SharePoint discussion boards, and content from websites in the Trusted sites zone in Internet Explorer. By default, Outlook considers trusted sites from Internet Explorer safe, and automatically downloads content from them, which could potentially include Web beacons. |
| V-17566 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Under normal circumstances the installed COM add-ins are applications that have been approved and intentionally deployed by the organization and therefore they should not pose a security threat. However, if malware has infected systems it is possible that the malware will use the COM add-in feature to perform unauthorized actions. This setting enforces the default configuration, and therefore is unlikely to cause significant usability issues for most users. |
| V-17568 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application accesses the address book, the application could gain access to sensitive data and potentially change that data. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to access the address book programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts. * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note--This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17569 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook uses two levels of security to restrict access to files attached to email messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. If users can demote Level 1 files to Level 2, they will be able to access potentially dangerous files after saving them to disk, which could allow malicious code to affect their computers or compromise the security of sensitive information. |
| V-17570 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A custom form in Outlook could be used to gain access to sensitive address book data and potentially to change that data. By default, when a user tries to bind an address information field to a combination or formula custom field in a custom form, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note: This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17571 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application uses the Save As command to programmatically save an item, the application could add malicious data to a user's inbox, a public folder, or an address book. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to use the Save As command, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note: This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17572 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application accesses the recipient fields, the application could gain access to sensitive data and potentially change that data. This could result in mail being sent to the wrong party. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to access recipient fields, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note: This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17573 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application programmatically responds to tasks or meeting requests, that application could impersonate a user response to the tasks or meeting requests with false information. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to respond to tasks or meeting requests programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note This described default functionality assumes that you have not followed the recommendation to enable the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected.  |
| V-17574 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application programmatically sends email, that application could send mail that includes malicious code, impersonate a user, or launch a denial of service attack by sending a large volume of mail to a user or group of users. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to send mail programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note--This described default functionality assumes that you have not followed the recommendation to enable the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17575 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Outlook object model includes entry points to access Outlook data, save data to specified locations, and send email messages, all of which can be used by malicious application developers. To help protect these entry points, the Object Model Guard warns users and prompts them for confirmation when untrusted code, including add-ins, attempts to use the object model to obtain email address information, store data outside of Outlook, execute certain actions, and send email messages. To reduce excessive security warnings when add-ins are used, administrators can specify a list of trusted add-ins that can access the Outlook object model silently, without raising prompts. This trusted add-in list should be treated with care, because a malicious add-in could access and forward sensitive information if added to the list. |
| V-17587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | As a security precaution, password caching for email Internet protocols such as POP3 or IMAP may lead to password discovery and eventually to data loss. An attacker that is able to access the users' profile may be able to acquire these cached passwords; they could then use this information to compromise the users' email accounts and other systems that use the same credentials. |
| V-17601 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from viruses and other harmful files, Outlook uses two levels of security, designated Level 1 and Level 2, to restrict access to files attached to email messages or other items. Potentially harmful files can be classified into these two levels by file type extension, with all other file types considered safe. By default, Outlook completely blocks access to Level 1 files, and requires users to save Level 2 files to disk before opening them. If this configuration is changed, users will be able to open and execute potentially dangerous attachments, which can affect their computers or compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data. |
| V-17602 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from viruses and other harmful files, Outlook 2013 uses two levels of security, designated Level 1 and Level 2, to restrict access to files attached to e-mail messages or other items. Outlook completely blocks access to Level 1 files by default, and requires users to save Level 2 files to disk before opening them. Potentially harmful files can be classified into these two levels by file type extension, with all other file types considered safe. By default, when users attempt to send an item to which a level 1 file has been attached, Outlook warns them that the message contains a potentially unsafe attachment and that the recipient might not be able to access it. If this configuration is changed, Outlook will not display the warning when users send such items, which can cause users to lose access to important data. |
| V-17610 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Many RSS feeds use messages that contain a brief summary of a larger message or an article with a link to the full content. Users can configure Outlook to automatically download the linked content as message attachments for individual RSS feeds. If a feed is frequently updated or typically contains very large messages and is not AutoArchived regularly, downloading full articles can cause the affected message store to become very large, which can affect the performance of Outlook. By default, Outlook does not automatically download the full text of RSS entries when retrieving feeds. |
| V-17613 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook's Junk E-mail Filter evaluates each incoming message for possible spam or phishing content. Suspicious message detection is always turned on. By default, Outlook handles suspicious messages in two ways: * If the Junk E-mail Filter does not consider a message to be spam but does consider it to be phishing, the message is left in the Inbox but any links in the message are disabled and users cannot use the Reply and Reply All functionality. In addition, any attachments in the suspicious message are blocked. * If the Junk E-mail Filter considers the message to be both spam and phishing, the message is automatically sent to the Junk E-mail folder. Any message sent to the Junk E-mail folder is converted to plain text format and all links are disabled. In addition, the Reply and Reply All functionality is disabled and any attachments in the message are blocked. The InfoBar alerts users to this change in functionality. If users are certain that a message is legitimate, they can click the InfoBar and enable the links in the message. Users can change the way Outlook handles phishing messages in the Junk E-mail Options dialog box by clearing the Disable links and other functionality in phishing messages (Recommended) check box. If this check box is cleared, Outlook will not disable links in suspected phishing messages unless they are classified as junk email, which could allow users to disclose confidential information to malicious websites. |
| V-17615 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The remote procedure call (RPC) communication channel between an Outlook client computer and an Exchange server is not encrypted. If a malicious individual is able to eavesdrop on the network traffic between Outlook and the server, they might be able to access confidential information. |
| V-17624 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook is designed to intercept the most obvious junk email, or spam, and send it to users' Junk E-mail folders. The filter evaluates each incoming message based on several factors, including the time when the message was sent and the content of the message. The filter does not single out any particular sender or message type, but instead analyzes each message based on its content and structure to discover whether or not it is probably spam. By default, the Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook is enabled. If this configuration is changed, users can receive large amounts of junk email in their Inboxes, which could make it difficult for them to work with business-related email messages. |
| V-17630 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether recipients open the messages. Viewing email messages that contain Web beacons provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. By default, Outlook does not download external content in HTML email messages from untrusted senders via the Internet. If this configuration is changed, Outlook will display external content in all HTML email messages received from the Internet, which could include Web beacons. |
| V-17634 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether recipients open the messages. Viewing email messages with Web beacons in them provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. By default, Outlook does not download external content in HTML email messages from untrusted senders over the local intranet. If this configuration is changed, Outlook will display external content in all HTML email messages received via the local intranet, which could include Web beacons. |
| V-17671 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from viruses and other harmful files, Outlook uses two levels of security, designated Level 1 and Level 2, to restrict access to files attached to email messages or other items. Potentially harmful files can be classified into these two levels by file type extension, with all other file types considered safe. By default, Outlook completely blocks access to Level 1 files, and requires users to save Level 2 files to disk before opening them. If this configuration is changed, users will be able to open and execute potentially dangerous attachments, which can affect their computers or compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data. |
| V-17672 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether specific recipients open the message. Viewing an email message that contains a Web beacon provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. By default, Outlook does not download external content in HTML email and RSS items unless the content is considered safe. Content that Outlook can be configured to consider safe includes: * Content in email messages from senders and to recipients defined in the Safe Senders and Safe Recipients lists. * Content from websites in Internet Explorer's Trusted Sites security zone. * Content in RSS items. * Content from SharePoint Discussion Boards. Users can control what content is considered safe by changing the options in the Automatic Download section of the Trust Center. If Outlook's default blocking configuration is overridden, in the Trust Center or by some other method, Outlook will display external content in all HTML email messages, including any that include Web beacons. |
| V-17673 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can create and use signatures in email messages. Users can add signatures to messages manually, and can also configure Outlook to automatically append signatures to new messages, to replies and forwards, or to all three. Signatures typically include details such as the user's name, title, phone numbers, and office location. When an organization has policies that govern the distribution of this kind of information, using signatures might cause some users to inadvertently violate these policies. |
| V-17674 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook allows users to designate Web pages as home pages for personal or public folders. When a user clicks on a folder, Outlook displays the home page the user has assigned to it. Although this feature provides the opportunity to create powerful public folder applications, scripts can be included on Web pages that access the Outlook object model, which exposes users to security risks. By default, Outlook does not allow users to define folder home pages for folders in non-default stores. If this configuration is changed, users can create and access dangerous folder home pages for Outlook data files (.pst) and other non-default stores, which can compromise the security of the users' data. |
| V-17675 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | In Outlook, folders can be associated with custom forms or folder home pages that include scripts that access the Outlook object model. These scripts can add functionality to the folders and items contained within, but dangerous scripts can pose security risks. By default, Outlook allows scripts included in custom forms or folder home pages for public folders to execute. If users inadvertently run dangerous scripts when using public folders, their computers or data could be at risk. |
| V-17676 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | In Outlook, folders can be associated with custom forms or folder home pages that include scripts that access the Outlook object model. These scripts can add functionality to the folders and items contained within, but dangerous scripts can pose security risks. By default, Outlook does not allow scripts included in custom forms or folder home pages for shared folders to execute. If this configuration is changed, users can inadvertently run dangerous scripts when using shared folders, which can put their computers or data at risk. |
| V-17678 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Internet Calendar feature in Outlook enables users to publish calendars online (using the webcal:// protocol) and subscribe to calendars that others have published. When users subscribe to an Internet calendar, Outlook queries the calendar at regular intervals and downloads any changes as they are posted. By default, Outlook allows users to subscribe to Internet calendars. When an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as Internet calendars, this feature will enable users to violate those policies. |
| V-17733 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Secure Temporary Files folder is used to store attachments when they are opened in email. By default, Outlook generates a random name for the Secure Temporary Files folder and saves it in the Temporary Internet Files folder. This setting can be used to designate a specific path and folder to use as the Secure Temporary Files folder. This configuration is not recommended, because it means that all users will have temporary Outlook files in the same predictable location, which is not as secure. If the name of this folder is well known, a malicious user or malicious code might target this location to try and gain access to attachments. |
| V-17734 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Exchange Server supports the Kerberos authentication protocol and NTLM for authentication. The Kerberos protocol is the more secure authentication method and is supported on Windows 2000 Server and later versions. NTLM authentication is supported in pre-Windows 2000 environments. When authentication is enabled, Outlook will attempt to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol, if it cannot (because no Windows 2000 or later domain controllers are available), it will authenticate using NTLM, ensuring a more secure authentication to the Exchange server. |
| V-17738 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Files attached to Internet Calendar appointments could contain malicious code that could be used to compromise a computer. By default, Outlook does not download attachments when retrieving Internet Calendar appointments. |
| V-17739 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, or pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether specific recipients have opened a message. Viewing an email message that contains a Web beacon provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. To help protect users from Web beacons, Outlook can be configured to automatically block the display of external content in email messages. However, because this configuration could block desirable content from display, Outlook can also be configured to automatically display external content in any messages sent by people who are listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists. By default, Outlook automatically displays external content in email messages from people listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists, and automatically blocks external content in other messages. If a malicious sender is accidentally added to a user's Safe Senders List or Safe Recipients List, Outlook will display external content in all email messages from the malicious sender, which could include Web beacons. |
| V-17753 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook is made the default program for email, contacts, and calendar services when it is installed, although users can designate other programs as the default programs for these services. If another application is used to provide these services and the organization does not ensure the security of that application, it could be exploited to gain access to sensitive information or launch other malicious attacks. When an organization has policies that govern the use of personal information management software, allowing users to change the default configuration could enable them to violate such policies. |
| V-17755 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Email typically travels over open networks and is passed from server to server. Messages are therefore vulnerable to interception, and attackers might read or alter their contents. It is therefore important to have a mechanism for signing messages and providing end-to-end encryption. Outlook supports three formats for encrypting and signing messages: S/MIME, Exchange, and Fortezza. By default, Outlook only uses S/MIME to encrypt and sign messages. When an organization has policies that mandate the use of specific encryption formats, allowing users to choose freely between these formats could cause them to violate such policies. |
| V-17756 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When Outlook accesses a certificate, it validates that it can trust the certificate by examining the root certificate of the issuing CA. If the root certificate can be trusted, then certificates issued by the CA can also be trusted. If Outlook cannot find the root certificate, it cannot validate that any certificates issued by that CA can be trusted. An attacker may compromise a root certificate and then remove the certificate in an attempt to conceal the attack. By default, Outlook displays a warning message when a CRL is not available. |
| V-17760 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If users can configure security themselves, they might choose levels of security that leave their computers vulnerable to attack. By default, Outlook users can configure security for themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings that are configured in Group Policy. |
| V-17761.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If outgoing mail is formatted in certain ways, for example, if attachments are encoded in UUENCODE format, attackers might manipulate the messages for their own purposes. If UUENCODE formatting is used, an attacker could manipulate the encoded attachment to bypass content filtering software. Outlook 2013 automatically wraps plain text messages and uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments in plain text messages. However, these settings can be altered to allow email to be read in plain text email programs that use a nonstandard line length or that cannot process MIME attachments. |
| V-17761.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If outgoing mail is formatted in certain ways, for example, if attachments are encoded in UUENCODE format, attackers might manipulate the messages for their own purposes. If UUENCODE formatting is used, an attacker could manipulate the encoded attachment to bypass content filtering software. Outlook 2013 automatically wraps plain text messages and uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments in plain text messages. However, these settings can be altered to allow email to be read in plain text email programs that use a nonstandard line length or that cannot process MIME attachments. |
| V-17762 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. Unlike the Microsoft Office Online Calendar Sharing Service, which allows users to manage other people's access to their calendars, DAV access restrictions can only be accomplished through server and folder permissions, and might require the assistance of the server administrator to set up and maintain. If these permissions are not managed properly, unauthorized individuals could access sensitive information. |
| V-17763 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can share their calendars with selected others by publishing them to the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. Users can control who can view their calendar and at what level of detail. When an organization has policies that govern access to external resources such as Office Online, allowing users to publish their calendars will enable them to violate those policies. |
| V-17766 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | All installed trusted COM addins can be trusted. Exchange settings for the addins still override if present and this option is selected. |
| V-17770 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook can display email messages and other items in three formats: plain text, Rich Text Format (RTF), and HTML. By default, Outlook displays email messages in whatever format they were received in. |
| V-17771 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook can display email messages and other items in three formats: plain text, Rich Text Format (RTF), and HTML. By default, Outlook displays digitally signed email messages in the format they were received in. |
| V-17774 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious code is often spread through e-mail. Some viruses have the ability to send copies of themselves to other people in the victim's Address Book or Contacts list, and such potentially harmful files can affect the computers of unwary recipients. |
| V-17775 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious code is often spread through email. Some viruses have the ability to send copies of themselves to other people in the victim's Address Book or Contacts list, and such potentially harmful files can affect the computers of unwary recipients. Outlook uses two levels of security to restrict users' access to files attached to email messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. By default, Outlook classifies a number of potentially harmful file types as Level 1. (See Attachment file types restricted by Outlook for the complete list.) Outlook does not classify any file types as Level 2 by default, so this setting is not particularly useful in isolation. Typically, if there are extensions on the Level 2 list they would have been added by using the "Add file extensions to block as Level 2" setting, through which they can be removed. The combined lists of blocked and restricted file extensions that Outlook uses are actually built by combining various policies together. If a machine policy classifies an extension as Level 2, this setting could be used to remove the extension from the list in some situations. As with Level 1 extensions, though, removing restrictions on potentially dangerous extensions can make it easier for users to open dangerous files, which can significantly reduce security. |
| V-17776 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can share their calendars with selected others by publishing them to the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. Users can choose from three levels of detail: * Availability only. Authorized visitors will see the user's time marked as Free, Busy, tentative, or Out of Office, but will not be able to see the subjects or details of calendar items. * Limited details. Authorized visitors can see the user's availability and the subjects of calendar items only. They will not be able to view the details of calendar items. Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items. * Full details. Authorized visitors can see the full details of calendar items. Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items and to access attachments within calendar items. If users are allowed to publish limited or full details, sensitive information in their calendars could become exposed to parties who are not authorized to have that information. |
| V-17777 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users publish their calendar to Microsoft Office Online using the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service, Outlook updates the calendars online at regular intervals unless they click Advanced and select Single Upload: Updates will not be uploaded from the Published Calendar Settings dialog box. When an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as Microsoft Office Online, allowing Outlook to publish calendar updates automatically might violate those policies. |
| V-17778 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Outlook retrieves Certificate Revocation Lists to verify the validity of certificates. Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are lists of digital certificates that have been revoked by their controlling certificate authorities (CAs), typically because the certificates were issued improperly or their associated private keys were compromised.  |
| V-17787 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook can run in a mode that complies with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), a set of standards published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for use by non-military United States government agencies and by government contractors. By default, Outlook does not run in FIPS-compliant mode. Organizations that do business with the U.S. government but do not run Outlook in FIPS-compliant mode risk violating the government's rules regarding the handling of sensitive information. |
| V-17790 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | In some situations, administrators might wish to use an external program, such as an add-in, to handle S/MIME message decryption. If your organization works with encrypted messages that the decryption functionality in Outlook cannot handle appropriately, this setting can be used to configure Outlook to hand S/MIME messages off to an external program for decryption. If no external program has been authorized however, misconfiguring this setting could allow unauthorized and potentially dangerous programs to handle encrypted messages, which could compromise security. |
| V-17795 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Incoming signed or encrypted messages might include S/MIME receipt requests. S/MIME receipts provide confirmation that messages are received unaltered, and can include information about who opened the message and when it was opened. By default, when users open messages with attached receipt requests, Outlook prompts them to decide whether to send a receipt to the sender with information about the identity of the user who opened the message and the time it was opened. If Outlook cannot send the receipt, the user is still allowed to open the message. In some situations, allowing Outlook to automatically send receipt requests could cause sensitive information to be divulged to unauthorized individuals. |
| V-17798 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from dangerous code, the Outlook default configuration disables all macros that are not trusted, including unsigned macros, macros with expired or invalid signatures, and macros with valid signatures from publishers who are not on users' Trusted Publishers lists. The default configuration also allows macros that are signed by trusted publishers to run automatically without notifying users, which could allow dangerous code to run. |
| V-17800 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users sign email messages with their signing certificate and send them, Outlook uses the sender's private key to encrypt the digital signature but sends the messages as clear text, unless they are encrypted separately. If users change this functionality by clearing the "Send clear text signed message when sending signed messages" option in the email Security section of the Trust Center, any recipients who are unable to access or use the sender's digital certificate will not be able to read the email messages. |
| V-17802 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Custom actions add functionality to Outlook that can be triggered as part of a rule. Among other possible features, custom actions can be created that reply to messages in ways that circumvent the Outlook model's programmatic send protections. By default, when Outlook or another program initiates a custom action using the Outlook object model, users are prompted to allow or reject the action. If this configuration is changed, malicious code can use the Outlook object model to compromise sensitive information or otherwise cause data and computing resources to be at risk. |
| V-17803 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If users open email messages that include invalid digital signatures, Outlook displays a warning dialog box. Users can decide whether they want to be warned about invalid signatures in the future. If users are not notified about invalid signatures, they might be prevented from detecting a fraudulent signature sent by a malicious person. |
| V-17806 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Common Feed list is a hierarchical set of RSS feeds to which clients such as Outlook 2013, the Feeds list in Internet Explorer, and the Feed Headlines Sidebar gadget in Windows Vista can subscribe. If Outlook subscribes to a very large feed list, performance and availability can be affected, especially if Outlook is configured to download full RSS message bodies or if the feed list is not AutoArchived regularly. By default, Outlook maintains its own list of feeds and does not automatically subscribe to RSS feeds that are added to the Common Feed List. |
| V-17807 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Email addresses in users' Contacts list are treated as safe senders for purposes of filtering junk email. If this configuration is changed, email from users' Contacts might be misclassified as junk and cause important information to be lost. |
| V-17808 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can subscribe to RSS feeds from within Outlook and read RSS items like email messages. If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as RSS feeds, allowing users to subscribe to the RSS feed in Outlook will enable them to violate those policies. |
| V-17812 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users drag email messages from Outlook to a Windows Explorer window or to their Desktop, Outlook creates an .msg file using the native character encoding format for the configured locale (the so-called "ANSI" format). If this setting is Enabled, Outlook uses the Unicode character encoding standard to create the message file, which preserves special characters in the message. However, Unicode text is vulnerable to homograph attacks, in which characters are replaced by different but similar-looking characters. For example, the Cyrillic letter "?" (U+0430) appears identical to the Latin letter "a" (U+0061) in many typefaces, but is actually a different character. Homographs can be used in "phishing" attacks to convince victims to visit fraudulent websites and enter sensitive information. |
| V-17944 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If users are able to manually enter the addresses of servers that are not approved by the organization, they could use servers that do not meet your organization's information security requirements, which could cause sensitive information to be at risk. By default, when users create a meeting workspace, they can choose a server from a default list provided by administrators or manually enter the address of a server that is not listed. |
| V-26584 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers. |
| V-26585 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26586 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26588 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-26632 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls Outlook's ability to automatically download enclosures on RSS items. |
| V-26633 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook automatically converts RTF formatted messages that are sent over the Internet to HTML format, so that the message formatting is maintained and attachments are received. This setting controls how Outlook sends Rich Text Format (RTF) messages to Internet recipients. |
| V-26634 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook uses HTML as the default email format. HTML format poses a security risk by embedding information into the email itself, which could allow for release of sensitive information. If a user attempted to insert an HTML link into an email message, the link itself may direct to a malicious website. By sending in that format, the recipient would be subject to becoming infected by the malicious website. |
| V-26635 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy prompts the user to choose security settings if default settings fail, but allowing users to select their own security settings would result in inconsistent enforcement in the organization and the likelihood of nonsecure settings being applied. |
| V-26636 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting allows the minimum key length for an encrypted email message to be configured. |
| V-26637 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls whether replies and forwards to signed/encrypted mail should also be signed/encrypted.  |
| V-26702 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook verifies the user's email address with the address associated with the certificate used for signing. |
| V-41492 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Weather Bar in Outlook displays weather conditions and forecast for a geographic location. By default, Outlook uses weather data provided by MSN Weather. The Weather Bar supports third-party weather data web services that follow a defined protocol to communicate with Outlook. As long as a third-party weather data service supports this protocol, users can choose that weather data service to provide weather data in the Weather Bar. Since the Weather Bar communicates to external, commercial weather sites, enabling it introduces the possibility of connections to malicious sites that could download malware into the environment. |
| V-41493 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The ability of Outlook to automatically turn text that represents Internet and network paths into hyperlinks would allow users to click on those hyperlinks in email message and access malicious or otherwise harmful websites. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-17173 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous web pages, which would pose a security risk. |
| V-17174 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-17175 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run. |
| V-17183 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur. |
| V-17184 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk. |
| V-17470 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | By default, Outlook automatically downloads content from sites that are considered "safe," as defined in the Security tab of the Internet Options dialog box in Internet Explorer. This configuration could allow users to inadvertently download Web beacons that reveal their identity to spammers and other malicious people. |
| V-17546 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to the Microsoft Office Online Calendar Sharing Services and to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. Office Online allows users to choose whether to restrict access to their calendars to people they invite, or allow unrestricted access to anyone who knows the URL to reach the calendar. DAV access restrictions can only be achieved through server and folder permissions, and might require the assistance of a server administrator to set up and maintain. If a calendar is visible to anyone on Office Online or third-party DAV servers, sensitive calendar information might be revealed. |
| V-17558 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users could send email messages to request that they be taken off a mailing list. If the email recipient is then automatically added to the Safe Senders List, future e mail messages from that address will no longer be sent to the users Junk email folder, even if it would otherwise be considered junk. By default, recipients of outgoing messages are not added automatically to individual users' Safe Senders Lists. However, users can change this configuration in the Outlook user interface. |
| V-17559 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Third-party ActiveX controls are not allowed to run in one-off forms in Outlook. This behavior can be changed so that Safe Controls (Microsoft Forms 2.0 controls and the Outlook Recipient and Body controls) are allowed in one-off forms, or so that all ActiveX controls are allowed to run. |
| V-17562 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious code can be included within Outlook forms, and such code could be executed when users open the form. By default, Outlook does not run scripts in forms in which the script and the layout are contained within the message. |
| V-17564 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious users can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether specific recipients open the message. Viewing an email message that contains a Web beacon provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. To reduce the risk from Web beacons, Outlook disables external content in email messages by default, unless the content is considered "safe" as determined by the check boxes in the Automatic Download section of the Trust Center. Depending on how these options are configured, safe content can include content in messages from addresses defined in the Safe Senders and Safe Recipients Lists used by the Junk email filter, content from SharePoint discussion boards, and content from websites in the Trusted sites zone in Internet Explorer. By default, Outlook considers trusted sites from Internet Explorer safe, and automatically downloads content from them, which could potentially include Web beacons. |
| V-17566 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Under normal circumstances the installed COM add-ins are applications that have been approved and intentionally deployed by the organization and therefore they should not pose a security threat. However, if malware has infected systems it is possible that the malware will use the COM add-in feature to perform unauthorized actions. This setting enforces the default configuration, and therefore is unlikely to cause significant usability issues for most users. |
| V-17568 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application accesses the address book, the application could gain access to sensitive data and potentially change that data. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to access the address book programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts. * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note--This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17569 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook uses two levels of security to restrict access to files attached to email messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. If users can demote Level 1 files to Level 2, they will be able to access potentially dangerous files after saving them to disk, which could allow malicious code to affect their computers or compromise the security of sensitive information. |
| V-17570 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A custom form in Outlook could be used to gain access to sensitive address book data and potentially to change that data. By default, when a user tries to bind an address information field to a combination or formula custom field in a custom form, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note: This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17571 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application uses the Save As command to programmatically save an item, the application could add malicious data to a user's inbox, a public folder, or an address book. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to use the Save As command, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note: This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17572 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application accesses the recipient fields, the application could gain access to sensitive data and potentially change that data. This could result in mail being sent to the wrong party. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to access recipient fields, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note: This described default functionality assumes that the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy has not been followed. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17573 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application programmatically responds to tasks or meeting requests, that application could impersonate a user response to the tasks or meeting requests with false information. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to respond to tasks or meeting requests programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: • Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) • Every time • Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note This described default functionality assumes that you have not followed the recommendation to enable the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected.  |
| V-17574 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an untrusted application programmatically sends email, that application could send mail that includes malicious code, impersonate a user, or launch a denial of service attack by sending a large volume of mail to a user or group of users. By default, when an untrusted application attempts to send mail programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts: * Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting) * Every time * Not at all If the "Not at all" option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information. Note--This described default functionality assumes that you have not followed the recommendation to enable the "Outlook Security Mode" Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the "Programmatic Access" section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the "Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running" option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected. |
| V-17575 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Outlook object model includes entry points to access Outlook data, save data to specified locations, and send email messages, all of which can be used by malicious application developers. To help protect these entry points, the Object Model Guard warns users and prompts them for confirmation when untrusted code, including add-ins, attempts to use the object model to obtain email address information, store data outside of Outlook, execute certain actions, and send email messages. To reduce excessive security warnings when add-ins are used, administrators can specify a list of trusted add-ins that can access the Outlook object model silently, without raising prompts. This trusted add-in list should be treated with care, because a malicious add-in could access and forward sensitive information if added to the list. |
| V-17587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | As a security precaution, password caching for email Internet protocols such as POP3 or IMAP may lead to password discovery and eventually to data loss. An attacker that is able to access the users' profile may be able to acquire these cached passwords; they could then use this information to compromise the users' email accounts and other systems that use the same credentials. |
| V-17601 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from viruses and other harmful files, Outlook uses two levels of security, designated Level 1 and Level 2, to restrict access to files attached to email messages or other items. Potentially harmful files can be classified into these two levels by file type extension, with all other file types considered safe. By default, Outlook completely blocks access to Level 1 files, and requires users to save Level 2 files to disk before opening them. If this configuration is changed, users will be able to open and execute potentially dangerous attachments, which can affect their computers or compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data. |
| V-17602 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from viruses and other harmful files, Outlook 2013 uses two levels of security, designated Level 1 and Level 2, to restrict access to files attached to e-mail messages or other items. Outlook completely blocks access to Level 1 files by default, and requires users to save Level 2 files to disk before opening them. Potentially harmful files can be classified into these two levels by file type extension, with all other file types considered safe. By default, when users attempt to send an item to which a level 1 file has been attached, Outlook warns them that the message contains a potentially unsafe attachment and that the recipient might not be able to access it. If this configuration is changed, Outlook will not display the warning when users send such items, which can cause users to lose access to important data. |
| V-17610 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Many RSS feeds use messages that contain a brief summary of a larger message or an article with a link to the full content. Users can configure Outlook to automatically download the linked content as message attachments for individual RSS feeds. If a feed is frequently updated or typically contains very large messages and is not AutoArchived regularly, downloading full articles can cause the affected message store to become very large, which can affect the performance of Outlook. By default, Outlook does not automatically download the full text of RSS entries when retrieving feeds. |
| V-17613 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook's Junk E-mail Filter evaluates each incoming message for possible spam or phishing content. Suspicious message detection is always turned on. By default, Outlook handles suspicious messages in two ways: * If the Junk E-mail Filter does not consider a message to be spam but does consider it to be phishing, the message is left in the Inbox but any links in the message are disabled and users cannot use the Reply and Reply All functionality. In addition, any attachments in the suspicious message are blocked. * If the Junk E-mail Filter considers the message to be both spam and phishing, the message is automatically sent to the Junk E-mail folder. Any message sent to the Junk E-mail folder is converted to plain text format and all links are disabled. In addition, the Reply and Reply All functionality is disabled and any attachments in the message are blocked. The InfoBar alerts users to this change in functionality. If users are certain that a message is legitimate, they can click the InfoBar and enable the links in the message. Users can change the way Outlook handles phishing messages in the Junk E-mail Options dialog box by clearing the Disable links and other functionality in phishing messages (Recommended) check box. If this check box is cleared, Outlook will not disable links in suspected phishing messages unless they are classified as junk email, which could allow users to disclose confidential information to malicious websites. |
| V-17615 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The remote procedure call (RPC) communication channel between an Outlook client computer and an Exchange server is not encrypted. If a malicious individual is able to eavesdrop on the network traffic between Outlook and the server, they might be able to access confidential information. |
| V-17624 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook is designed to intercept the most obvious junk email, or spam, and send it to users' Junk E-mail folders. The filter evaluates each incoming message based on several factors, including the time when the message was sent and the content of the message. The filter does not single out any particular sender or message type, but instead analyzes each message based on its content and structure to discover whether or not it is probably spam. By default, the Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook is enabled. If this configuration is changed, users can receive large amounts of junk email in their Inboxes, which could make it difficult for them to work with business-related email messages. |
| V-17630 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether recipients open the messages. Viewing email messages that contain Web beacons provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. By default, Outlook does not download external content in HTML email messages from untrusted senders via the Internet. If this configuration is changed, Outlook will display external content in all HTML email messages received from the Internet, which could include Web beacons. |
| V-17634 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether recipients open the messages. Viewing email messages with Web beacons in them provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. By default, Outlook does not download external content in HTML email messages from untrusted senders over the local intranet. If this configuration is changed, Outlook will display external content in all HTML email messages received via the local intranet, which could include Web beacons. |
| V-17671 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from viruses and other harmful files, Outlook uses two levels of security, designated Level 1 and Level 2, to restrict access to files attached to email messages or other items. Potentially harmful files can be classified into these two levels by file type extension, with all other file types considered safe. By default, Outlook completely blocks access to Level 1 files, and requires users to save Level 2 files to disk before opening them. If this configuration is changed, users will be able to open and execute potentially dangerous attachments, which can affect their computers or compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data. |
| V-17672 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, which are pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether specific recipients open the message. Viewing an email message that contains a Web beacon provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. By default, Outlook does not download external content in HTML email and RSS items unless the content is considered safe. Content that Outlook can be configured to consider safe includes: * Content in email messages from senders and to recipients defined in the Safe Senders and Safe Recipients lists. * Content from websites in Internet Explorer's Trusted Sites security zone. * Content in RSS items. * Content from SharePoint Discussion Boards. Users can control what content is considered safe by changing the options in the Automatic Download section of the Trust Center. If Outlook's default blocking configuration is overridden, in the Trust Center or by some other method, Outlook will display external content in all HTML email messages, including any that include Web beacons. |
| V-17673 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can create and use signatures in email messages. Users can add signatures to messages manually, and can also configure Outlook to automatically append signatures to new messages, to replies and forwards, or to all three. Signatures typically include details such as the user's name, title, phone numbers, and office location. When an organization has policies that govern the distribution of this kind of information, using signatures might cause some users to inadvertently violate these policies. |
| V-17674 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook allows users to designate Web pages as home pages for personal or public folders. When a user clicks on a folder, Outlook displays the home page the user has assigned to it. Although this feature provides the opportunity to create powerful public folder applications, scripts can be included on Web pages that access the Outlook object model, which exposes users to security risks. By default, Outlook does not allow users to define folder home pages for folders in non-default stores. If this configuration is changed, users can create and access dangerous folder home pages for Outlook data files (.pst) and other non-default stores, which can compromise the security of the users' data. |
| V-17675 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | In Outlook, folders can be associated with custom forms or folder home pages that include scripts that access the Outlook object model. These scripts can add functionality to the folders and items contained within, but dangerous scripts can pose security risks. By default, Outlook allows scripts included in custom forms or folder home pages for public folders to execute. If users inadvertently run dangerous scripts when using public folders, their computers or data could be at risk. |
| V-17676 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | In Outlook, folders can be associated with custom forms or folder home pages that include scripts that access the Outlook object model. These scripts can add functionality to the folders and items contained within, but dangerous scripts can pose security risks. By default, Outlook does not allow scripts included in custom forms or folder home pages for shared folders to execute. If this configuration is changed, users can inadvertently run dangerous scripts when using shared folders, which can put their computers or data at risk. |
| V-17678 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Internet Calendar feature in Outlook enables users to publish calendars online (using the webcal:// protocol) and subscribe to calendars that others have published. When users subscribe to an Internet calendar, Outlook queries the calendar at regular intervals and downloads any changes as they are posted. By default, Outlook allows users to subscribe to Internet calendars. When an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as Internet calendars, this feature will enable users to violate those policies. |
| V-17733 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Secure Temporary Files folder is used to store attachments when they are opened in email. By default, Outlook generates a random name for the Secure Temporary Files folder and saves it in the Temporary Internet Files folder. This setting can be used to designate a specific path and folder to use as the Secure Temporary Files folder. This configuration is not recommended, because it means that all users will have temporary Outlook files in the same predictable location, which is not as secure. If the name of this folder is well known, a malicious user or malicious code might target this location to try and gain access to attachments. |
| V-17734 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Exchange Server supports the Kerberos authentication protocol and NTLM for authentication. The Kerberos protocol is the more secure authentication method and is supported on Windows 2000 Server and later versions. NTLM authentication is supported in pre-Windows 2000 environments. When authentication is enabled, Outlook will attempt to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol, if it cannot (because no Windows 2000 or later domain controllers are available), it will authenticate using NTLM, ensuring a more secure authentication to the Exchange server. |
| V-17738 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Files attached to Internet Calendar appointments could contain malicious code that could be used to compromise a computer. By default, Outlook does not download attachments when retrieving Internet Calendar appointments. |
| V-17739 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious email senders can send HTML email messages with embedded Web beacons, or pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether specific recipients have opened a message. Viewing an email message that contains a Web beacon provides confirmation that the recipient's email address is valid, which leaves the recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful email. To help protect users from Web beacons, Outlook can be configured to automatically block the display of external content in email messages. However, because this configuration could block desirable content from display, Outlook can also be configured to automatically display external content in any messages sent by people who are listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists. By default, Outlook automatically displays external content in email messages from people listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists, and automatically blocks external content in other messages. If a malicious sender is accidentally added to a user's Safe Senders List or Safe Recipients List, Outlook will display external content in all email messages from the malicious sender, which could include Web beacons. |
| V-17753 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook is made the default program for email, contacts, and calendar services when it is installed, although users can designate other programs as the default programs for these services. If another application is used to provide these services and the organization does not ensure the security of that application, it could be exploited to gain access to sensitive information or launch other malicious attacks. When an organization has policies that govern the use of personal information management software, allowing users to change the default configuration could enable them to violate such policies. |
| V-17755 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Email typically travels over open networks and is passed from server to server. Messages are therefore vulnerable to interception, and attackers might read or alter their contents. It is therefore important to have a mechanism for signing messages and providing end-to-end encryption. Outlook supports three formats for encrypting and signing messages: S/MIME, Exchange, and Fortezza. By default, Outlook only uses S/MIME to encrypt and sign messages. When an organization has policies that mandate the use of specific encryption formats, allowing users to choose freely between these formats could cause them to violate such policies. |
| V-17756 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When Outlook accesses a certificate, it validates that it can trust the certificate by examining the root certificate of the issuing CA. If the root certificate can be trusted, then certificates issued by the CA can also be trusted. If Outlook cannot find the root certificate, it cannot validate that any certificates issued by that CA can be trusted. An attacker may compromise a root certificate and then remove the certificate in an attempt to conceal the attack. By default, Outlook displays a warning message when a CRL is not available. |
| V-17760 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If users can configure security themselves, they might choose levels of security that leave their computers vulnerable to attack. By default, Outlook users can configure security for themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings that are configured in Group Policy. |
| V-17761.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If outgoing mail is formatted in certain ways, for example, if attachments are encoded in UUENCODE format, attackers might manipulate the messages for their own purposes. If UUENCODE formatting is used, an attacker could manipulate the encoded attachment to bypass content filtering software. Outlook 2013 automatically wraps plain text messages and uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments in plain text messages. However, these settings can be altered to allow email to be read in plain text email programs that use a nonstandard line length or that cannot process MIME attachments. |
| V-17761.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If outgoing mail is formatted in certain ways, for example, if attachments are encoded in UUENCODE format, attackers might manipulate the messages for their own purposes. If UUENCODE formatting is used, an attacker could manipulate the encoded attachment to bypass content filtering software. Outlook 2013 automatically wraps plain text messages and uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments in plain text messages. However, these settings can be altered to allow email to be read in plain text email programs that use a nonstandard line length or that cannot process MIME attachments. |
| V-17762 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. Unlike the Microsoft Office Online Calendar Sharing Service, which allows users to manage other people's access to their calendars, DAV access restrictions can only be accomplished through server and folder permissions, and might require the assistance of the server administrator to set up and maintain. If these permissions are not managed properly, unauthorized individuals could access sensitive information. |
| V-17763 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can share their calendars with selected others by publishing them to the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. Users can control who can view their calendar and at what level of detail. When an organization has policies that govern access to external resources such as Office Online, allowing users to publish their calendars will enable them to violate those policies. |
| V-17766 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | All installed trusted COM addins can be trusted. Exchange settings for the addins still override if present and this option is selected. |
| V-17770 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook can display email messages and other items in three formats: plain text, Rich Text Format (RTF), and HTML. By default, Outlook displays email messages in whatever format they were received in. |
| V-17771 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook can display email messages and other items in three formats: plain text, Rich Text Format (RTF), and HTML. By default, Outlook displays digitally signed email messages in the format they were received in. |
| V-17774 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious code is often spread through e-mail. Some viruses have the ability to send copies of themselves to other people in the victim's Address Book or Contacts list, and such potentially harmful files can affect the computers of unwary recipients. |
| V-17775 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious code is often spread through email. Some viruses have the ability to send copies of themselves to other people in the victim's Address Book or Contacts list, and such potentially harmful files can affect the computers of unwary recipients. Outlook uses two levels of security to restrict users' access to files attached to email messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. By default, Outlook classifies a number of potentially harmful file types as Level 1. (See Attachment file types restricted by Outlook for the complete list.) Outlook does not classify any file types as Level 2 by default, so this setting is not particularly useful in isolation. Typically, if there are extensions on the Level 2 list they would have been added by using the "Add file extensions to block as Level 2" setting, through which they can be removed. The combined lists of blocked and restricted file extensions that Outlook uses are actually built by combining various policies together. If a machine policy classifies an extension as Level 2, this setting could be used to remove the extension from the list in some situations. As with Level 1 extensions, though, removing restrictions on potentially dangerous extensions can make it easier for users to open dangerous files, which can significantly reduce security. |
| V-17776 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook users can share their calendars with selected others by publishing them to the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. Users can choose from three levels of detail: * Availability only. Authorized visitors will see the user's time marked as Free, Busy, tentative, or Out of Office, but will not be able to see the subjects or details of calendar items. * Limited details. Authorized visitors can see the user's availability and the subjects of calendar items only. They will not be able to view the details of calendar items. Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items. * Full details. Authorized visitors can see the full details of calendar items. Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items and to access attachments within calendar items. If users are allowed to publish limited or full details, sensitive information in their calendars could become exposed to parties who are not authorized to have that information. |
| V-17777 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users publish their calendar to Microsoft Office Online using the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service, Outlook updates the calendars online at regular intervals unless they click Advanced and select Single Upload: Updates will not be uploaded from the Published Calendar Settings dialog box. When an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as Microsoft Office Online, allowing Outlook to publish calendar updates automatically might violate those policies. |
| V-17778 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Outlook retrieves Certificate Revocation Lists to verify the validity of certificates. Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are lists of digital certificates that have been revoked by their controlling certificate authorities (CAs), typically because the certificates were issued improperly or their associated private keys were compromised.  |
| V-17787 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook can run in a mode that complies with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), a set of standards published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for use by non-military United States government agencies and by government contractors. By default, Outlook does not run in FIPS-compliant mode. Organizations that do business with the U.S. government but do not run Outlook in FIPS-compliant mode risk violating the government's rules regarding the handling of sensitive information. |
| V-17790 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | In some situations, administrators might wish to use an external program, such as an add-in, to handle S/MIME message decryption. If your organization works with encrypted messages that the decryption functionality in Outlook cannot handle appropriately, this setting can be used to configure Outlook to hand S/MIME messages off to an external program for decryption. If no external program has been authorized however, misconfiguring this setting could allow unauthorized and potentially dangerous programs to handle encrypted messages, which could compromise security. |
| V-17795 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Incoming signed or encrypted messages might include S/MIME receipt requests. S/MIME receipts provide confirmation that messages are received unaltered, and can include information about who opened the message and when it was opened. By default, when users open messages with attached receipt requests, Outlook prompts them to decide whether to send a receipt to the sender with information about the identity of the user who opened the message and the time it was opened. If Outlook cannot send the receipt, the user is still allowed to open the message. In some situations, allowing Outlook to automatically send receipt requests could cause sensitive information to be divulged to unauthorized individuals. |
| V-17798 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from dangerous code, the Outlook default configuration disables all macros that are not trusted, including unsigned macros, macros with expired or invalid signatures, and macros with valid signatures from publishers who are not on users' Trusted Publishers lists. The default configuration also allows macros that are signed by trusted publishers to run automatically without notifying users, which could allow dangerous code to run. |
| V-17800 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users sign email messages with their signing certificate and send them, Outlook uses the sender's private key to encrypt the digital signature but sends the messages as clear text, unless they are encrypted separately. If users change this functionality by clearing the "Send clear text signed message when sending signed messages" option in the email Security section of the Trust Center, any recipients who are unable to access or use the sender's digital certificate will not be able to read the email messages. |
| V-17802 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Custom actions add functionality to Outlook that can be triggered as part of a rule. Among other possible features, custom actions can be created that reply to messages in ways that circumvent the Outlook model's programmatic send protections. By default, when Outlook or another program initiates a custom action using the Outlook object model, users are prompted to allow or reject the action. If this configuration is changed, malicious code can use the Outlook object model to compromise sensitive information or otherwise cause data and computing resources to be at risk. |
| V-17803 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If users open email messages that include invalid digital signatures, Outlook displays a warning dialog box. Users can decide whether they want to be warned about invalid signatures in the future. If users are not notified about invalid signatures, they might be prevented from detecting a fraudulent signature sent by a malicious person. |
| V-17806 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Common Feed list is a hierarchical set of RSS feeds to which clients such as Outlook 2013, the Feeds list in Internet Explorer, and the Feed Headlines Sidebar gadget in Windows Vista can subscribe. If Outlook subscribes to a very large feed list, performance and availability can be affected, especially if Outlook is configured to download full RSS message bodies or if the feed list is not AutoArchived regularly. By default, Outlook maintains its own list of feeds and does not automatically subscribe to RSS feeds that are added to the Common Feed List. |
| V-17807 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Email addresses in users' Contacts list are treated as safe senders for purposes of filtering junk email. If this configuration is changed, email from users' Contacts might be misclassified as junk and cause important information to be lost. |
| V-17808 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can subscribe to RSS feeds from within Outlook and read RSS items like email messages. If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as RSS feeds, allowing users to subscribe to the RSS feed in Outlook will enable them to violate those policies. |
| V-17812 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users drag email messages from Outlook to a Windows Explorer window or to their Desktop, Outlook creates an .msg file using the native character encoding format for the configured locale (the so-called "ANSI" format). If this setting is Enabled, Outlook uses the Unicode character encoding standard to create the message file, which preserves special characters in the message. However, Unicode text is vulnerable to homograph attacks, in which characters are replaced by different but similar-looking characters. For example, the Cyrillic letter "?" (U+0430) appears identical to the Latin letter "a" (U+0061) in many typefaces, but is actually a different character. Homographs can be used in "phishing" attacks to convince victims to visit fraudulent websites and enter sensitive information. |
| V-17944 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If users are able to manually enter the addresses of servers that are not approved by the organization, they could use servers that do not meet your organization's information security requirements, which could cause sensitive information to be at risk. By default, when users create a meeting workspace, they can choose a server from a default list provided by administrators or manually enter the address of a server that is not listed. |
| V-26584 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers. |
| V-26585 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26586 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26588 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-26632 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls Outlook's ability to automatically download enclosures on RSS items. |
| V-26633 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook automatically converts RTF formatted messages that are sent over the Internet to HTML format, so that the message formatting is maintained and attachments are received. This setting controls how Outlook sends Rich Text Format (RTF) messages to Internet recipients. |
| V-26634 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Outlook uses HTML as the default email format. HTML format poses a security risk by embedding information into the email itself, which could allow for release of sensitive information. If a user attempted to insert an HTML link into an email message, the link itself may direct to a malicious website. By sending in that format, the recipient would be subject to becoming infected by the malicious website. |
| V-26635 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy prompts the user to choose security settings if default settings fail, but allowing users to select their own security settings would result in inconsistent enforcement in the organization and the likelihood of nonsecure settings being applied. |
| V-26636 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting allows the minimum key length for an encrypted email message to be configured. |
| V-26637 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls whether replies and forwards to signed/encrypted mail should also be signed/encrypted.  |
| V-26702 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook verifies the user's email address with the address associated with the certificate used for signing. |
| V-41492 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Weather Bar in Outlook displays weather conditions and forecast for a geographic location. By default, Outlook uses weather data provided by MSN Weather. The Weather Bar supports third-party weather data web services that follow a defined protocol to communicate with Outlook. As long as a third-party weather data service supports this protocol, users can choose that weather data service to provide weather data in the Weather Bar. Since the Weather Bar communicates to external, commercial weather sites, enabling it introduces the possibility of connections to malicious sites that could download malware into the environment. |
| V-41493 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The ability of Outlook to automatically turn text that represents Internet and network paths into hyperlinks would allow users to click on those hyperlinks in email message and access malicious or otherwise harmful websites. |

**Description:** The Microsoft Outlook 2016 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems.  Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via e-mail to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-71109 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a website). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous Web pages, which could pose a security risk. |
| V-71111 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-71113 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run.  |
| V-71115 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur.  |
| V-71117 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-71119 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers.  |
| V-71121 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk.  |
| V-71123 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71125 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71127 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations, and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71129 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook users can publish their calendars to the Office.com Calendar Sharing Service. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook users cannot publish their calendars to Office.com. If you disable do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can share their calendars with selected others by publishing them to the Microsoft Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. Users can control who can view their calendar and at what level of detail. |
| V-71131 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook users can publish their calendars to a DAV server. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook users cannot publish their calendars to a DAV server. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol.  |
| V-71133 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls the level of calendar details that Outlook users can publish to the Microsoft Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three levels of detail: * All options are available - This level of detail is the default configuration. * Disables 'Full details' * Disables 'Full details' and 'Limited details'. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can share their calendars with selected others by publishing them to the Microsoft Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. Users can choose from three levels of detail: * Availability only - Authorized visitors will see the user's time marked as Free, Busy, Tentative, or Out of Office, but will not be able to see the subjects or details of calendar items. * Limited details - Authorized visitors can see the user's availability and the subjects of calendar items only. They will not be able to view the details of calendar items. Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items. * Full details - Authorized visitors can see the full details of calendar items. Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items.  |
| V-71135 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines what restrictions apply to users who publish their calendars on Office.com or third-party World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers. If you enable or disable this policy setting, calendars that are published on Office.com must have restricted access (users other than the calendar owner/publisher who wish to view the calendar can only do so if they receive invitations from the calendar owner), and users cannot publish their calendars to third-party DAV servers. If you do not configure this policy setting, users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to the Office.com Calendar Sharing Services and to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. Office.com allows users to choose whether to restrict access to their calendars to people they invite, or allow unrestricted access to anyone who knows the URL to reach the calendar. DAV access restrictions can only be achieved through server and folder permissions, and might require the assistance of a server administrator to set up and maintain. |
| V-71145 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook executes scripts associated with custom forms or folder home pages for shared folders. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook cannot execute any scripts associated with shared folders, overriding any configuration changes on users' computers. If you disable this policy setting, Outlook will automatically run any scripts associated with custom forms or folder home pages for shared folders. If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of setting the policy to Enabled.  |
| V-71147 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook executes scripts that are associated with custom forms or folder home pages for public folders. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook cannot execute any scripts associated with public folders, overriding any configuration changes on users' computers. If you disable this policy setting, Outlook will automatically run any scripts associated with custom forms or folder home pages for public folders, overriding any configuration changes on users' computers. If you do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will not run any scripts associated with public folders by default. Users can configure the setting in the Trust Center by selecting the ôAllow script in public foldersö check box.  |
| V-71149 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | By default, third-party ActiveX controls are not allowed to run in one-off forms in Outlook. You can change this behavior so that Safe Controls (Microsoft Forms 2.0 controls and the Outlook Recipient and Body controls) are allowed in one-off forms, or so that all ActiveX controls are allowed to run.  |
| V-71151 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | All installed trusted COM addins can be trusted. Exchange Settings for the addins still override if present and this option is selected.  |
| V-71153 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Use this option to hide your user's ability to cache passwords locally in the computer's registry. When configured, this policy will hide the 'Remember Password' checkbox and not allow users to have Outlook remember their password. Note that POP3, IMAP, and HTTP e-mail accounts are all considered Internet e-mail accounts in Outlook. E-mail account options are listed on the Server Type dialog box when users choose 'New' under Tools | Account Settings.  |
| V-71155 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting prevents users from overriding the set of attachments blocked by Outlook. If you enable this policy setting users will be prevented from overriding the set of attachments blocked by Outlook. Outlook also checks the "Level1Remove" registry key when this setting is specified. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users will be allowed to override the set of attachments blocked by Outlook.  |
| V-71157 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls which set of security settings are enforced in Outlook. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for enforcing Outlook security settings: * Outlook Default Security - This option is the default configuration in Outlook. Users can configure security themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings configured in Group Policy. * Use Security Form from 'Outlook Security Settings' Public Folder - Outlook uses the settings from the security form published in the designated public folder. * Use Security Form from 'Outlook 10 Security Settings' Public Folder - Outlook uses the settings from the security form published in the designated public folder. * Use Outlook Security Group Policy - Outlook uses security settings from Group Policy. Important - You must enable this policy setting if you want to apply the other Outlook security policy settings mentioned in this guide. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can configure security for themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings that are configured in Group Policy. Note - In previous versions of Outlook, when security settings were published in a form in Exchange Server public folders, users who needed these settings required the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Security\CheckAdminSettings registry key to be set on their computers for the settings to apply. In Outlook, the CheckAdminSettings registry key is no longer used to determine users' security settings. Instead, the Outlook Security Mode setting can be used to determine whether Outlook security should be controlled directly by Group Policy, by the security form from the Outlook Security Settings Public Folder, or by the settings on users' own computers.  |
| V-71159 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook blocks potentially dangerous attachments designated Level 1. Outlook uses two levels of security to restrict users' access to files attached to e-mail messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook users can gain access to Level 1 file type attachments by first saving the attachments to disk and then opening them, as with Level 2 attachments. If you disable this policy setting, Level 1 attachments do not display under any circumstances. If you do not configure this policy setting, Outlook completely blocks access to Level 1 files, and requires users to save Level 2 files to disk before opening them.  |
| V-71161 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls which types of attachments (determined by file extension) Outlook prevents from being delivered. Outlook uses two levels of security to restrict users' access to files attached to e-mail messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the removal of file type extensions as that Outlook classifies as Level 1--that is, to be blocked from delivery--by entering them in the text field provided separated by semicolons. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook classifies a number of potentially harmful file types (such as those with .exe, .reg, and .vbs extensions) as Level 1 and blocks files with those extensions from being delivered. Important: This policy setting only applies if the "Outlook Security Mode" policy setting under "Microsoft Outlook 2016\Security\Security Form Settings" is configured to "Use Outlook Security Group Policy." |
| V-71163 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls which types of attachments (determined by file extension) must be saved to disk before users can open them. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify a list of attachment file types to classify as Level 2, which forces users to actively decide to download the attachment to view it. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not classify any file type extensions as Level 2. Important: This policy setting only applies if the "Outlook Security Mode" policy setting under "Microsoft Outlook 2016\Security\Security Form Settings" is configured to "Use Outlook Security Group Policy." |
| V-71165 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether scripts can run in Outlook forms in which the script and layout are contained within the message. If you enable this policy setting, scripts can run in one-off Outlook forms. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not run scripts in forms in which the script and the layout are contained within the message. Important: This policy setting only applies if the "Outlook Security Mode" policy setting under "Microsoft Outlook 2016\Security\Security Form Settings" is configured to "Use Outlook Security Group Policy."  |
| V-71167 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook prompts users before executing a custom action. Custom actions add functionality to Outlook that can be triggered as part of a rule. Among other possible features, custom actions can be created that reply to messages in ways that circumvent the Outlook model's programmatic send protections. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options to control how Outlook functions when a custom action is executed that uses the Outlook object model: * Prompt User * Automatically Approve * Automatically Deny * Prompt user based on computer security. This option enforces the default configuration in Outlook. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when Outlook or another program initiates a custom action using the Outlook object model, users are prompted to allow or reject the action. If this configuration is changed, malicious code can use the Outlook object model to compromise sensitive information or otherwise cause data and computing resources to be at risk. This is the equivalent of choosing Enabled -- Prompt user based on computer security.  |
| V-71169 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls what happens when an untrusted program attempts to send e-mail programmatically using the Outlook object model. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an untrusted program attempts to send e-mail programmatically using the Outlook object model: - Prompt user - The user will be prompted to approve every access attempt.- Automatically approve - Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is not recommended. - Automatically deny - Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program. - Prompt user based on computer security. Outlook will only prompt users when antivirus software is out of date or not running. Important: This policy setting only applies if the 'Outlook Security Mode' policy setting under 'Microsoft Outlook 2016\Security\Security Form Settings' is configured to 'Use Outlook Security Group Policy'. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when an untrusted application attempts to send mail programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center.  |
| V-71171 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls what happens when an untrusted program attempts to gain access to an Address Book using the Outlook object model. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an untrusted program attempts to programmatically access an Address Book using the Outlook object model:- Prompt user - Users are prompted to approve every access attempt. - Automatically approve - Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is not recommended. - Automatically deny - Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program.- Prompt user based on computer security - Outlook will rely on the setting in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center. This is the default behavior. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when an untrusted application attempts to access the address book programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center.  |
| V-71173 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls what happens when an untrusted program attempts to gain access to a recipient field, such as the 'To:' field, using the Outlook object model. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an untrusted program attempts to access a recipient field using the Outlook object model:- Prompt user. The user will be prompted to approve every access attempt.- Automatically approve. Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is not recommended.- Automatically deny. Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program.- Prompt user based on computer security. Outlook will only prompt users when antivirus software is out of date or not running. This is the default configuration. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when an untrusted application attempts to access recipient fields, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center.  |
| V-71175 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls what happens when an untrusted program attempts to programmatically send e-mail in Outlook using the Response method of a task or meeting request. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an untrusted program attempts to programmatically send e-mail using the Response method of a task or meeting request:- Prompt user. The user will be prompted to approve every access attempt.- Automatically approve. Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is not recommended.- Automatically deny. Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program. - Prompt user based on computer security. Outlook only prompts users when antivirus software is out of date or not running. This is the default configuration. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when an untrusted application attempts to respond to tasks or meeting requests programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center.  |
| V-71177 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls what happens when an untrusted program attempts to use the Save As command to programmatically save an item. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an untrusted program attempts to use the Save As command to programmatically save an item:- Prompt user. The user will be prompted to approve every access attempt. - Automatically approve. Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is not recommended. - Automatically deny. Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program.- Prompt user based on computer security. Outlook will only prompt users when antivirus software is out of date or not running. This is the default configuration. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when an untrusted application attempts to use the Save As command, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center.  |
| V-71179 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls what happens when a user designs a custom form in Outlook and attempts to bind an Address Information field to a combination or formula custom field. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an untrusted program attempts to access address information using the UserProperties. Find method of the Outlook object model: - Prompt user. The user will be prompted to approve every access attempt. - Automatically approve. Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is not recommended. - Automatically deny. Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program. - Prompt user based on computer security. Outlook will only prompt users when antivirus software is out of date or not running. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when a user tries to bind an address information field to a combination or formula custom field in a custom form, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center.  |
| V-71193 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting can be used to specify a list of trusted add-ins that can be run without being restricted by the security measures in Outlook. If you enable this policy setting, a list of trusted add-ins and hashes is made available that you can modify by adding and removing entries. The list is empty by default. To create a new entry, enter a DLL file name in the 'Value Name' column and the hash result in the 'Value' column. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the list of trusted add-ins is empty and unused, so the recommended EC and SSLF settings do not create any usability issues. However, users who rely on add-ins that access the Outlook object model might be repeatedly prompted unless administrators enable this setting and add the add-ins to the list.Note - You can also configure Exchange Security Form settings by enabling the 'Outlook Security Mode' setting in User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Outlook 2016\Security\Security Form Settings\Microsoft Outlook 2016 Security and selecting 'Use Outlook Security Group Policy' from the drop-down list.  |
| V-71195 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook decodes encrypted messages itself or passes them to an external program for processing. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options for configuring external S/MIME clients:- Handle internally. Outlook decrypts all S/MIME messages itself.- Handle externally. Outlook hands all S/MIME messages off to the configured external program.- Handle if possible. Outlook attempts to decrypt all S/MIME messages itself. If it cannot decrypt a message, Outlook hands the message off to the configured external program. This option is the default configuration. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of selecting Enabled: Handle if possible.  |
| V-71227 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls which message encryption formats Outlook can use. Outlook supports three formats for encrypting and signing messages: S/MIME, Exchange, and Fortezza. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify whether Outlook can use S/MIME (the default), Exchange, or Fortezza encryption, or any combination of any of these options. Users will not be able to change this configuration. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook only uses S/MIME to encrypt and sign messages. If you disable this policy setting, users will not be able to change this configuration.  |
| V-71229 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook is required to use FIPS-compliant algorithms when signing and encrypting messages. Outlook can run in a mode that complies with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), a set of standards published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for use by non-military United States government agencies and by government contractors. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook runs in a mode that complies with the FIPS 140-1 standard for cryptographic modules. This mode requires the use of the SHA-1 algorithm for signing and 3DES for encryption. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not run in FIPS-compliant mode. Organizations that do business with the United States government but do not run Outlook in FIPS-compliant mode risk violating the U.S. government's rules regarding the handling of sensitive information.For more information about FIPS, see FIPS - General Information at http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/geninfo.htm  |
| V-71231 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook sends signed messages as clear text signed messages. If you enable this policy setting, the "Send clear text signed message when sending signed messages" option is selected in the E-mail Security section of the Trust Center. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when users sign e-mail messages with their digital signature and send them, Outlook uses the signature's private key to encrypt the digital signature but sends the messages as clear text, unless they are encrypted separately.  |
| V-71233 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Outlook handles S/MIME receipt requests. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling S/MIME receipt requests in Outlook:- Open message if receipt can't be sent- Don't open message if receipt can't be sent- Always prompt before sending receipt- Never send S/MIME receipts. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when users open messages with attached receipt requests, Outlook prompts them to decide whether to send a receipt to the sender with information about the identity of the user who opened the message and the time it was opened. If Outlook cannot send the receipt, the user is still allowed to open the message.  |
| V-71235 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Outlook retrieves Certificate Revocation Lists to verify the validity of certificates.Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are lists of digital certificates that have been revoked by their controlling certificate authorities (CAs), typically because the certificates were issued improperly or their associated private keys were compromised. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options to govern how Outlook uses CRLs: - Use system Default. Outlook relies on the CRL download schedule that is configured for the operating system. - When online always retrieve the CRL. This option is the default configuration in Outlook. - Never retrieve the CRL. Outlook will not attempt to download the CRL for a certificate, even if it is online. This option can reduce security. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when Outlook handles a certificate that includes a URL from which a CRL can be downloaded, Outlook will retrieve the CRL from the provided URL if Outlook is online.  |
| V-71237 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting setting controls whether Outlook downloads untrusted pictures and external content located in HTML e-mail messages without users explicitly choosing to download them. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will not automatically download content from external servers unless the sender is included in the Safe Senders list. Recipients can choose to download external content from untrusted senders on a message-by-message basis. If you disable this policy setting, Outlook will display pictures and external content in HTML e-mail automatically.If you do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not download external content in HTML e-mail and RSS items unless the content is considered safe. Content that Outlook can be configured to consider safe includes: - Content in e-mail messages from senders and to recipients defined in the Safe Senders and Safe Recipients lists. - Content from Web sites in Internet Explorer's Trusted Sites security zone. - Content in RSS items. - Content from SharePoint Discussion Boards. Users can control what content is considered safe by changing the options in the "Automatic Download" section of the Trust Center. If Outlook's default blocking configuration is overridden, in the Trust Center or by some other method, Outlook will display external content in all HTML e-mail messages, including any that include Web beacons.  |
| V-71239 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook automatically downloads external content in e-mail from senders in the Safe Senders List or Safe Recipients List. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook automatically downloads content for e-mail from people in Safe Senders and Safe Recipients lists. If you disable this policy setting, Outlook will not automatically download content from external servers for messages sent by people listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists. Recipients can choose to download external content on a message-by-message basis. If you do not configure this policy setting, downloads are permitted when users receive e-mail from people listed in the user's Safe Senders List or Safe Recipients List.  |
| V-71241 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook automatically downloads content from safe zones when displaying messages. If you enable this policy setting content from safe zones will be downloaded automatically. If you disable this policy Outlook will not automatically download content from safe zones. Recipients can choose to download external content from untrusted senders on a message-by-message basis. If you do not configure this policy setting, Outlook automatically downloads content from sites that are considered "safe," as defined in the Security tab of the Internet Options dialog box in Internet Explorer. Important - Note that this policy setting is "backward." Despite the name, disabling the policy setting prevents the download of content from safe zones and enabling the policy setting allows it.  |
| V-71243 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether pictures from sites in the Trusted Sites security zone are automatically downloaded in Outlook e-mail messages and other items. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook does not automatically download content from Web sites in the Trusted sites zone in Internet Explorer. Recipients can choose to download external content on a message-by-message basis. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook automatically downloads content from Web sites in the Trusted sites zone in Internet Explorer.  |
| V-71245 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether pictures and external content in HTML e-mail messages from untrusted senders on the Internet are downloaded without Outlook users explicitly choosing to do so. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will automatically download external content in all e-mail messages sent over the Internet and users will not be able to change the setting. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not consider the Internet a safe zone, which means that Outlook will not automatically download content from external servers unless the sender is included in the Safe Senders list. Recipients can choose to download external content from untrusted senders on a message-by-message basis.  |
| V-71247 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether pictures and external content in HTML e-mail messages from untrusted senders on the local intranet are downloaded without Outlook users explictly choosing to do so. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will automatically download external content in all e-mail messages sent over the local intranet and users will not be able to change the setting. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not consider the local intranet a safe zone, which means that Outlook will not automatically download content from other servers in the Local Intranet zone unless the sender is included in the Safe Senders list. Recipients can choose to download external content from untrusted senders on a message-by-message basis.  |
| V-71249 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls the security level for macros in Outlook. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling macros in Outlook: - Always warn. This option corresponds to the "Warnings for all macros" option in the "Macro Security" section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled. - Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the "No warnings and disable all macros" option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users. - Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the "Warnings for signed macros; all unsigned macros are disabled" option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows: --If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher. --If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future. --If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location. This option is the default configuration in Outlook. - No security check. This option corresponds to the "No security check for macros (Not recommended)" option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of Enabled -- Warning for signed, disable unsigned.  |
| V-71251 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether hyperlinks in suspected phishing e-mail messages in Outlook are allowed. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will allow hyperlinks in suspected phishing messages that are not also classified as junk e-mail. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will not allow hyperlinks in suspected phishing messages, even if they are not classified as junk e-mail.  |
| V-71253 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook uses remote procedure call (RPC) encryption to communicate with Microsoft Exchange servers. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook uses RPC encryption when communicating with an Exchange server. Note - RPC encryption only encrypts the data from the Outlook client computer to the Exchange server. It does not encrypt the messages themselves as they traverse the Internet. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, RPC encryption is still used by default. This setting allows you to override the corresponding per-profile setting.  |
| V-71255 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls which authentication method Outlook uses to authenticate with Microsoft Exchange Server. Note - Exchange Server supports the Kerberos authentication protocol and NTLM for authentication. The Kerberos protocol is the more secure authentication method and is supported on Windows 2000 Server and later versions. NTLM authentication is supported in pre-Windows 2000 environments. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three different options for controlling how Outlook authenticates with Microsoft Exchange Server:- Kerberos/NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If this attempt fails, Outlook attempts to authenticate using NTLM. This option is the default configuration.- Kerberos password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using the Kerberos protocol only.- NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using NTLM only. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will attempt to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If it cannot (because no Windows 2000 or later domain controllers are available), it will authenticate using NTLM.  |
| V-71259 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook automatically makes an offline copy of the RSS items as HTML attachments. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook automatically makes an offline copy of RSS items as HTML attachments. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will not automatically make an offline copy of RSS items as HTML attachments.  |
| V-71261 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook downloads files attached to Internet Calendar appointments. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook automatically downloads all Internet Calendar appointment attachments. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not download attachments when retrieving Internet Calendar appointments.  |
| V-71263 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine whether or not you want to include Internet Calendar integration in Outlook. The Internet Calendar feature in Outlook enables users to publish calendars online (using the webcal:// protocol) and subscribe to calendars that others have published. When users subscribe to an Internet calendar, Outlook queries the calendar at regular intervals and downloads any changes as they are posted. If you enable this policy setting, all Internet calendar functionality in Outlook is disabled. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook allows users to subscribe to Internet calendars.  |
| V-71265 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook users can add entries to the list of SharePoint servers when establishing a meeting workspace. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose between two options to determine whether Outlook users can add entries to the published server list: - Publish default, allow others. This option is the default configuration in Outlook. - Publish default, disallow others. This option prevents users from adding servers to the default published server list. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when users create a meeting workspace, they can choose a server from a default list provided by administrators or manually enter the address of a server that is not listed. This is the equivalent of Enabled -- Publish default, allow others.  |
| V-71267 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to control whether Outlook automatically downloads enclosures on RSS items. If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will automatically download enclosures on RSS items. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, enclosures on RSS items are not downloaded by default.  |
| V-71271 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Check to prompt the user to choose security settings if default settings fail; uncheck to automatically select.  |
| V-71273 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to set the minimum key length for an encrypted e-mail message. If you enable this policy setting, you may set the minimum key length for an encrypted e-mail message. Outlook will display a warning dialog if the user tries to send a message using an encryption key that is below the minimum encryption key value set. The user can still choose to ignore the warning and send using the encryption key originally chosen. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a dialog warning will be shown to the user if the user attempts to send a message using encryption. The user can still choose to ignore the warning and send using the encryption key originally chosen.  |
| V-71275 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether replies and forwards to signed/encrypted mail should also be signed/encrypted. If you enable this policy setting, signing/encryption will be turned on when replying/forwarding a signed or encrypted message, even if the user is not configured for SMIME. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, signing/encryption is not enforced.  |
| V-71277 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Outlook verifies the user's e-mail address with the address associated with the certificate used for signing. If you enable this policy setting, users can send messages signed with certificates that do not match their e-mail addresses. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook verifies that the user's e-mail address matches the certificate being used for signing.  |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-17173 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous web pages, which could pose a security risk. |
| V-17174 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-17175 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet; Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run. |
| V-17183 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur. |
| V-17184 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk. |
| V-17187 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an application is configured to require all add-ins to be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message informing users about the unsigned add-in. If a user is allowed to make the determination to allow an unsigned add-in, it increases the risk of malicious code being introduced onto the user's computer or the network. |
| V-17322 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ersions of file formats from pre-release versions of Office applications may introduce bugs found in those pre-release versions of the applications which have been subsequently fixed in the final release version. |
| V-17471 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Trusted locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures and could harm users' computers or data. By default, files located in trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) are assumed to be safe. |
| V-17473 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When an Office Open XML document (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) is rights-managed, or password-protected, any macros embedded in the document are encrypted along with the rest of the contents. By default, these encrypted macros will be disabled unless they are scanned by antivirus software immediately before being loaded. If this default configuration is modified, Office products will not require encrypted macros to be scanned before loading. They will be handled as specified by the Office System macro security settings, which can cause macro viruses to load undetected and lead to data loss or reduced application functionality. |
| V-17520 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Files located in Trusted Locations and specified in the Trust Center are assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from Trusted Locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. By default, users can specify Trusted Locations on network shares, or in other remote locations not under their direct control, by selecting the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network" (not recommended) check box in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to typical security measures and could affect users' computers or data. |
| V-17521 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users create new PowerPoint files, PowerPoint 2013 saves them in the new *.pptx format. Ensure this setting is enabled to specify that all new files are created in PowerPoint 2013. If a new file is created in an earlier format, some users may not be able to open or use the file, or they may choose a format this is less secure than the PowerPoint 2013 format. Users can still select a specific format when they save files, but they cannot change default of this setting from the PowerPoint Options dialog box. This enforced user behavior ensures any change to the file format requires additional deliberate user interaction. |
| V-17522 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | STO projects require access to the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, even though the projects do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Design-time support of controls in both Visual Basic and C# projects depends on the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Word and Excel. By default, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint do not allow automation clients to have programmatic access to VBA projects. Users can enable this by selecting the Trust access to the VBA project object model in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. However, doing so allows macros in any documents the user opens to access the core Visual Basic objects, methods, and properties, which represents a potential security hazard. |
| V-17545 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users open files containing VBA macros, applications open the files with the macros disabled and displays the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users may then enable these macros by clicking Options on the Trust Bar and selecting the option to enable them. Disabling or not configuring this setting may allow dangerous macros to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-17752 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | PowerPoint presentations that are saved in standard or HTML format can contain a flag indicating whether markup (comments or ink annotations) in the presentation should be visible when the presentation is open. PowerPoint ignores this flag when opening a file, and always displays any markup present in the file. In addition, when saving a file, PowerPoint sets the flag to display markup when the presentation is next opened. If this default configuration is changed, PowerPoint sets the flag according to the state of the Show Markup option on the Review tab of the Ribbon when it saves presentations in standard or HTML format. In addition, PowerPoint enables or disables the Show Markup option according to the way the flag is set when it opens files, which means that a presentation saved with hidden markup is opened with the markup still hidden. If a file is saved with hidden markup, users might inadvertently distribute sensitive comments or information to others via the presentation file. |
| V-17788 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Action buttons can be used to launch external programs from PowerPoint presentations. If a malicious person adds an action button to a presentation that launches a dangerous program, it could significantly affect the security of a user's computer and data. |
| V-17809 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users insert images into PowerPoint presentations, they can select Link to File instead of Insert. If they do so, the image is represented by a link to a file on disk instead of being embedded in the presentation file itself. By default, when PowerPoint opens a presentation it does not display any linked images saved on a different computer unless the presentation itself is saved in a trusted location (as configured in the Trust Center). If this configuration is changed, PowerPoint will load any images that were saved in remote locations, which presents a security risk.  |
| V-26584 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers. |
| V-26585 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on the user's computer or the network. |
| V-26586 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on the user's computer or the network. |
| V-26587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on the user's computer or the network. |
| V-26588 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-26589 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office 2013 applications do not check the digital signature on application add-ins before opening them. Disabling or not configuring this setting may allow an application to load a dangerous add-in. As a result, malicious code could become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26592 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office File Validation helps detect and prevent a kind of exploit known as a file format attack or file fuzzing attack. File format attacks exploit the integrity of a file. They occur when someone modifies the structure of a file with the intent of adding malicious code. Usually the malicious code is run remotely and is used to elevate the privilege of restricted accounts on the computer. As a result, an attacker could gain access to a computer that they did not previously have access to. This could enable an attacker to read sensitive information from the computer's hard disk drive or install malware, such as a worm or a key logging program. The Office File Validation feature helps prevent file format attacks by scanning and validating files before they are opened. To validate files, Office File Validation compares a file's structure to a predefined file schema, which is a set of rules that determine what a readable file looks like. If Office File Validation detects that a file's structure does not follow all rules that are described in the schema, the file does not pass validation. |
| V-26612 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can open, view, or edit a large number of file types in PowerPoint 2013. Some file types are safer than others, as some could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. For this reason, disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26614 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining if files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. |
| V-26615 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines if files located in unsafe locations will open in Protected View. If unsafe locations have not been specified, only the "Downloaded Program Files" and "Temporary Internet Files" folders are considered unsafe locations. If enabling this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations open in Protected View. |
| V-26616.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy key controls the behavior of how Office documents should be handled when failing file validation. By requiring such documents to be opened in Protected View, any potentially malicious code would be disabled, allowing the user to edit the document and resave correctly. |
| V-26616.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy key controls the behavior of how Office documents should be handled when failing file validation. By requiring such documents to be opened in Protected View, any potentially malicious code would be disabled, allowing the user to edit the document and resave correctly. |
| V-26617 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining if PowerPoint files in Outlook attachments open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, Outlook attachments do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, Outlook attachments open in Protected View. |
| V-26639 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls whether users can link slides in a presentation with their counterparts in a PowerPoint Slide Library. If this policy setting is enabled, PowerPoint cannot check the status of a slide in a Slide Library when a presentation with Slide Update data is opened. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, each time users open a presentation that contains a shared slide, PowerPoint notifies them if the slide has been updated and provides them with the opportunity to ignore the update, append a new slide to the outdated slide, or replace the outdated slide with the updated one. |
| V-42327 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous web pages, which could pose a security risk.  |
| V-42328 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on the user's computer or the network. |
| V-42329 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on the user's computer or the network. |
| V-42330 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk. |
| V-42331 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on the user's computer or the network.  |
| V-42332 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-42333 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet; Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run. |
| V-42334 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur. |
| V-42335 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-42336 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers. |
| V-72839 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to block macros from running in Office files that come from the Internet. If you enable this policy setting, macros are blocked from running, even if "Enable all macros" is selected in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. Also, instead of having the choice to "Enable Content", users will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. If the Office file is saved to a trusted location or was previously trusted by the user, macros will be allowed to run. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the settings configured in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center determine whether macros run in Office files that come from the Internet. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-70641 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a website). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous Web pages, which could pose a security risk.  |
| V-70643 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine if users can open, view, or edit Word files. If you enable this policy setting, you can set one of these options:- Blocked files are not opened- Blocked files open in Protected View and can not be edited- Blocked files open in Protected View and can be edited. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the same as the "Blocked files are not opened" setting. Users will not be able to open blocked files. |
| V-70645 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load.  |
| V-70647 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run.  |
| V-70649 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to turn off the file validation feature. If you enable this policy setting, file validation will be turned off. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, file validation will be turned on. Office Binary Documents (97-2003) are checked to see if they conform against the file format schema before they are opened.  |
| V-70651 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine if files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. If you enable this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone do not open in Protected View. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View.  |
| V-70653 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers.  |
| V-70655 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether add-ins for this applications must be digitally signed by a trusted publisher. If you enable this policy setting, this application checks the digital signature for each add-in before loading it. If an add-in does not have a digital signature, or if the signature did not come from a trusted publisher, this application disables the add-in and notifies the user. Certificates must be added to the Trusted Publishers list if you require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher. For detail on about obtaining and distributing certificates, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294922. Office 2016 stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Office 2016 still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Office and you upgrade to Office 2016, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. For more information about trusted publishers, see the Office Resource Kit. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, this application does not check the digital signature on application add-ins before opening them. If a dangerous add-in is loaded, it could harm users' computers or compromise data security.  |
| V-70657 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk.  |
| V-70659 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the specified Office application notifies users when unsigned application add-ins are loaded or silently disable such add-ins without notification. This policy setting only applies if you enable the "Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher" policy setting, which prevents users from changing this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, applications automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users. If you disable this policy setting, if this application is configured to require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message that informs users about the unsigned add-in. If you do not configure this policy setting, the disable behavior applies, and in addition, users can configure this requirement themselves in the "Add-ins" category of the Trust Center for the application.  |
| V-70661 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-70663 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows administrators to disable all trusted locations in the specified applications. Trusted locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations that are assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures and could harm users' computers or data. If you enable this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are ignored, including any trusted locations established by Office 2016 during setup, deployed to users using Group Policy, or added by users themselves. Users will be prompted again when opening files from trusted locations. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are assumed to be safe.  |
| V-70665 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the "Add new location" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers. Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center. We recommended that you do not enable this policy setting (as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box also states). Therefore, in practice, it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users. If you do not enable this policy setting, users can select the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box if desired and then specify trusted locations by clicking the "Add new location" button.  |
| V-70667 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting governs the default format for new presentation files that users create. If you enable this policy setting, when a user creates a new blank presentation, it is in the specified default format. Users may still override the default and specify a specific format when they create a presentation. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, PowerPoint Presentation is the default option.  |
| V-70669 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether encrypted macros in Open XML presentations are required to be scanned with anti-virus software before being opened. If you enable this policy setting, you may choose one of these options:- Scan encrypted macros: encrypted macros are disabled unless anti-virus software is installed. Encrypted macros are scanned by your anti-virus software when you attempt to open an encrypted presentation that contains macros.- Scan if anti-virus software available: if anti-virus software is installed, scan the encrypted macros first before allowing them to load. If anti-virus software is not available, allow encrypted macros to load.- Load macros without scanning: do not check for anti-virus software and allow macros to be loaded in an encrypted file. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior will be similar to the "Scan encrypted macros" option.  |
| V-70671 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether automation clients such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Microsoft Office (VSTO) can access the Visual Basic for Applications project system in the specified applications. VSTO projects require access to the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, even though the projects do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Design-time support of controls in both Visual Basic and C# projects depends on the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Word and Excel. If you enable this policy setting, VSTO and other automation clients can access the Visual Basic for Applications project system in the specified applications. Users will not be able to change this behavior through the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" user interface option under the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. If you disable this policy setting, VSTO does not have programmatic access to VBA projects. In addition, the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" check box is cleared and users cannot change it. Note: Disabling this policy setting prevents VSTO projects from interacting properly with the VBA project system in the selected application. If you do not configure this policy setting, automation clients do not have programmatic access to VBA projects. Users can enable this by selecting the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" in the "Macro Settings" section of the Trust Center. However, doing so allows macros in any documents the user opens to access the core Visual Basic objects, methods, and properties, which represents a potential security hazard.  |
| V-70673 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-70675 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations, and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-70677 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls the prompting and activation behavior for the "Run Programs" option for action buttons in PowerPoint. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options to control how the "Run Programs" option functions:- Disable (don't run any programs). If users click an action button with the "Run Programs" action assigned to it, nothing will happen. This option enforces the default configuration in PowerPoint.- Enable (prompt user before running). If users click an action button with the "Run Programs" action assigned to it, PowerPoint will prompt them to continue before running the program.- Enable all (run without prompting). If users click an action button with the "Run Programs" action assigned to it. PowerPoint will run the program automatically, without prompting. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, if users click an action with the "Run Programs" action assigned to it, nothing will happen. This behavior is the same as Enabled -- Disable (don't run any programs).  |
| V-70679 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining whether PowerPoint files in Outlook attachments open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, Outlook attachments do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, Outlook attachments open in Protected View.  |
| V-70681 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. If you disable this policy setting, "Disable all with notification" will be the default setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar. If the user clicks "Enable Content", then the document is added as a trusted document. Important: If "Disable all except digitally signed macros" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases. Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Microsoft Office and you upgrade to Office, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store.  |
| V-70683 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a website). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous Web pages, which could pose a security risk.  |
| V-70685 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control.

This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load.  |
| V-70687 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page).

If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur.  |
| V-70691 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-70693 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers.  |
| V-70695 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk.  |

This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-70701 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to block macros from running in Office files that come from the Internet. If you enable this policy setting, macros are blocked from running, even if 'Enable all macro's is selected in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. Also, instead of having the choice to 'Enable Content', users will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. If the Office file is saved to a trusted location or was previously trusted by the user, macros will be allowed to run. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the settings configured in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center determine whether macros run in Office files that come from the Internet.  |
| V-71401 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur. |

Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-71405 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether files located in unsafe locations will open in Protected View. If unsafe locations have not been specified, only the "Downloaded Program Files" and "Temporary Internet Files" folders are considered unsafe locations. If enabling this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations open in Protected View. |
| V-71407.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Office handles documents when they fail file validation. If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the following options for files that fail file validation:- Block files completely. Users cannot open the files.- Open files in Protected View and disallow edit. Users cannot edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you disable this policy setting.- Open files in Protected View and allow edit. Users can edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you do not configure this policy setting.If you disable this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and disallow edit" behavior. If you do not configure this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and allow edit" behavior. |
| V-71407.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Office handles documents when they fail file validation. If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the following options for files that fail file validation:- Block files completely. Users cannot open the files.- Open files in Protected View and disallow edit. Users cannot edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you disable this policy setting.- Open files in Protected View and allow edit. Users can edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you do not configure this policy setting.If you disable this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and disallow edit" behavior. If you do not configure this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and allow edit" behavior. |
| V-71641 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting lets you determine if files on local Intranet UNC file shares open in Protected View. If you enable this policy setting, files on local Intranet UNC file shares open in Protected View if their UNC paths appear to be within the Internet zone. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, files on Intranet UNC file shares do not open in Protected View if their UNC paths appear to be within the Internet zone. |
| V-71647 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-17547.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. To indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe For Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates a control is safe to open and run, and it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible the control could adversely affect a computer—or it could mean the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future. By default, if a control is marked SFI, the application loads the control in safe mode and uses persisted values (if any). If the control is not marked SFI, the application loads the control in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or uses the default (first-time initialization) settings. In both situations, the Message Bar informs users the controls have been disabled and prompts them to respond. |

If the control is not marked SFI, the application loads the control in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or uses the default (first-time initialization) settings. In both situations, the Message Bar informs users the controls have been disabled and prompts them to respond. |
| V-17560 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When Microsoft Office files are opened from trusted locations, all the content in the files is enabled and active. Users are not notified about any potential risks that might be contained in the files, such as unsigned macros, ActiveX controls, or links to content on the Internet. By default, users can specify any location as a trusted location, and a computer can have a combination of user-created, OCT-created, and Group Policy–created trusted locations. |
| V-17581 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The blogging feature in Office products enables users to compose blog entries and post them to their blogs directly from Office, without using any additional software. By default, users can post blog entries to any compatible blogging service provider, including Windows Live Spaces, Blogger, a SharePoint or Community Server site, and others. Leaving this capability enabled introduces the risk of users posting confidential and FOUO date to non-DoD sites. |
| V-17583 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Windows Rights Management Add-on for Internet Explorer provides a way for users who do not use the 2013 Office release to view, but not alter, files with restricted permissions. By default, IRM-enabled files are saved in a format that cannot be viewed by using the Windows Rights Management Add-on. If this setting is enabled, an embedded rights-managed HTML version of the content is saved with each IRM-enabled file, which can be viewed in Internet Explorer using the add-on, representing the risk of documents being read by those without the rights and not intended to have access to the document. |
| V-17590 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Message Bar in Office applications is used to identify security issues, such as unsigned macros or potentially unsafe add-ins. When such issues are detected, the application disables the unsafe feature or content and displays the Message Bar at the top of the active window. The Message Bar informs the users about the nature of the security issue and, in some cases, provides the users with an option to enable the potentially unsafe feature or content, which could harm the user's computer. By default, if an Office application detects a security issue, the Message Bar is displayed. However, this configuration can be modified by users in the Trust Center.  |
| V-17605 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether users see a security warning when they open custom Document Information Panels that contain a web beaconing threat. Web beacons can be used to contact an external server when users open forms. Information could be gathered by the form, or information entered by users could be sent to an external server, exposing the internal users and systems to additional attacks. |
| V-17612 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users choose to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP), Office applications automatically send information to Microsoft about how the applications are used. This information is combined with other CEIP data to help Microsoft solve problems and to improve the products and features customers use most often. This feature does not collect users' names, addresses, or any other identifying information except the IP address that is used to send the data. By default, users have the opportunity to opt into participation in the CEIP the first time they run an Office application. If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as the CEIP, allowing users to opt in to the program might cause them to violate these policies. |
| V-17617 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If unencrypted files are intercepted, sensitive information in the files can be compromised. To protect information confidentiality, Microsoft Office application files can be encrypted and password protected. Only users who know the correct password will be able to decrypt such files. Since some encryption types are less secure and easier to breach, Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider, AES-256, 256-bit should be used when encrypting documents. |
| V-17619 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If unencrypted files are intercepted, sensitive information in the files can be compromised. To protect information confidentiality, Microsoft Office application files can be encrypted and password protected. Only users who know the correct password will be able to decrypt such files. Since some encryption types are less secure and easier to breach, Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider, AES-256, 256-bit should be used when encrypting documents. |
| V-17627 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Help Improve Proofing Tools" feature collects data about use of the Proofing Tools, such as additions to the custom dictionary, and sends it to Microsoft. After about six months, the feature stops sending data to Microsoft and deletes the data collection file from the user's computer. Although this feature does not intentionally collect personal information, some of the content sent could include items that were marked as spelling or grammar errors, such as proper names and account numbers. However, any numbers such as account numbers, street addresses, and phone numbers are converted to zeroes when the data is collected. Microsoft uses this information solely to improve the effectiveness of the Office Proofing Tools, not to identify users. By default, this feature is enabled, if users choose to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as the CEIP, allowing the use of the "Help Improve Proofing Tools" feature might cause them to violate these policies. |
| V-17659 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Unsafe hyperlinks are links that might pose a security risk if users click them. Clicking an unsafe link could compromise the security of sensitive information or harm the computer. Links that Office considers unsafe include links to executable files, TIFF files, and Microsoft Document Imaging (MDI) files. Other unsafe links are those using protocols considered to be unsafe, including msn, nntp, mms, outlook, and stssync. |
| V-17660 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If the Microsoft Save as PDF or XPS Add-in for Microsoft Office Programs is installed, document properties are saved as metadata when users save or publish files using the PDF or XPS commands in Access 2013, Excel 2013, InfoPath 2013, PowerPoint 2013, and Word 2013 using the PDF or XPS or Publish. If this metadata contains sensitive information, saving it with the file could compromise security. |
| V-17661 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Excel, PowerPoint, and Word users can use the Internet Fax feature to send documents to fax recipients through an Internet fax service provider. If your organization has policies that govern the time, place, or manner in which faxes are sent, this feature could help users evade those policies. By default, Office users can use the Internet Fax feature.  |
| V-17664 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Opt-in Wizard displays the first time users run a 2013 Microsoft Office application, which allows them to opt into Internet-based services that will help improve their Office experience, such as Microsoft Update, the Customer Experience Improvement Program, Office Diagnostics, and Online Help. If an organization has policies that govern the use of such external resources, allowing users to opt in to these services might cause them to violate the policies. |
| V-17665 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If 2013 Office users add passwords to documents, other users can be prevented from opening the documents. This capability can provide an extra level of protection to documents already protected by access control lists, or provide a means of securing documents not protected by file-level security. By default, users can add passwords to Excel 2013 workbooks, PowerPoint 2013 presentations, and Word 2013 documents from the Save or Save As dialog box by clicking Tools, clicking General Options, and entering appropriate passwords to open or modify the documents. If this configuration is changed, the General Options dialog box for saving with a password will not be available for the user to password-protect their documents. |
| V-17669 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | An XML expansion pack is the group of files that constitutes a Smart Document in Excel and Word. One or more components that provide the logic needed for a Smart Document are packaged by using an XML expansion pack. These components can include any type of file, including XML schemas, Extensible Stylesheet Language Transforms (XSLTs), dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), and image files, as well as additional XML files, HTML files, Word files, Excel files, and text files. The key component to building an XML expansion pack is creating an XML expansion pack manifest file. By creating this file, the locations of all files that make up the XML expansion pack are specified, as well as information that instructs Office 2013 how to set up the files for the Smart Document. The XML expansion pack can also contain information about how to set up other files, such as how to install and register a COM object required by the XML expansion pack. XML expansion packs can be used to initialize and load malicious code, which might affect the stability of a computer and lead to data loss. Office applications can load an XML expansion pack manifest file with a Smart Document. |
| V-17670 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users of Office applications can see and use links to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server sites from those applications. Administrators configure published links to Office applications during initial deployment, and can add or change links as part of regular operations. These links appear on the My SharePoint Sites tab of the Open, Save, and Save As dialog boxes when opening and saving documents from these applications. Links can be targeted so that they only appear to users who are members of particular audiences. If a malicious person gains access to the list of published links, they could modify the links to point to unapproved sites, which could make sensitive data vulnerable to exposure. |
| V-17731 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users are not required to connect to the network to verify permissions. If users do not need their licenses confirmed when attempting to open Office documents, they might be able to access documents after their licenses have been revoked. Also, it is not possible to log the usage of files with restricted permissions if users' licenses are not confirmed. |
| V-17740 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Having access to updates, add-ins, and patches on the Office Online website can help users ensure computers are up to date and equipped with the latest security patches. However, to ensure updates are tested and applied in a consistent manner, many organizations prefer to roll out updates using a centralized mechanism such as Microsoft Systems Center or Windows Server Update Services. By default, users are allowed to download updates, add-ins, and patches from the Office Online Web site to keep their Office applications running smoothly and securely. If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as Office Online, allowing users to download updates might cause them to violate these policies. |
| V-17741 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When a separate program is used to launch Microsoft Office Excel, PowerPoint, or Word programmatically, any macros can run in the programmatically opened application without being blocked. This functionality could allow an attacker to use automation to run malicious code in Excel, PowerPoint, or Word. |
| V-17749 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office applications use the XML-based XMLDSIG format to attach digital signatures to documents, including Office 97-2003 binary documents. XMLDSIG signatures are not recognized by Office 2003 applications or previous versions. If an Office user opens an Excel, PowerPoint, or Word binary document with an XMLDSIG signature attached, the signature will be lost. |
| V-17750.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization (SFI), which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date. SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety is not important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode. |
| V-17750.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization (SFI), which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date. SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety is not important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode. |
| V-17759 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | By default, when an Office 2013 document on a web server is opened using Internet Explorer, the appropriate application opens the file in read-only mode. However, if the default configuration is changed, the document is opened as read/write. Users could potentially make changes to documents and resave them in situations where the web server security is not configured to prevent such changes. |
| V-17765 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls whether Office 2013 users can change permissions for content that is protected with Information Rights Management (IRM). The Information Rights Management feature of Office 2013 allows individuals and administrators to specify access permissions to Word documents, Excel workbooks, PowerPoint presentations, InfoPath templates and forms, and Outlook email messages. This functionality helps prevent sensitive information from being printed, forwarded, or copied by unauthorized people. |
| V-17768 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When an Office Open XML document is protected with a password and saved, any metadata associated with the document is encrypted along with the rest of the document's contents. If this configuration is changed, potentially sensitive information such as the document author and hyperlink references could be exposed to unauthorized people.  |
| V-17769 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When Information Rights Management (IRM) is used to restrict access to an Office Open XML document, any metadata associated with the document is not encrypted. This configuration could allow potentially sensitive information such as the document author and hyperlink references to be exposed to unauthorized individuals. |
| V-17773 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When saving documents as web pages, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word can save vector-based graphics in Vector Markup Language (VML), which enables Internet Explorer to display them smoothly at any resolution. By default, when saving VML graphics, Office applications also save copies of the graphics in a standard raster file format (GIF or PNG) for use by browsers that cannot display VML. If the "Rely on VML for displaying graphics in browsers" check box in the web Options dialog box is selected, applications will not save raster copies of VML graphics, which means those graphics will not display in non-Microsoft browsers. |
| V-17805 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can select Add Signature Services (from the Signature Line drop-down menu on the Insert tab of the Ribbon in Excel 2013, PowerPoint 2013, and Word 2013) to see a list of signature service providers on the Microsoft Office website. If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as signature providers or Office Marketplace, allowing users to access the Add Signature Services menu item might enable them to violate those policies. |
| V-26630 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Office 2013 Help system automatically searches MicrosoftOffice.com for content when a computer is connected to the Internet. Users can change this default by clearing the Search Microsoft Office.com for Help content when I'm connected to the Internet check box in the Privacy Options section of the Trust Center. If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as Office.com, allowing the Help system to download content might cause users to violate these policies. |
| V-26704 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows a document's properties to be encrypted. This applies to OLE documents (Office 97-2003 compatible) if the application is configured for CAPI RC4. Disabling this setting will prevent the encryption of document properties, which may expose sensitive data. |
| V-40858.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the Office automatic updates are enabled or disabled for all Office products installed via Click-to-Run. This policy has no effect on Office products installed via Windows Installer. If this policy setting is enabled, Office periodically checks for updates. When updates are detected, Office downloads and applies them in the background. If policy setting is disabled, Office will not check for updates. Without receiving automatic updates, vulnerabilities found within the Office products will not be applied, leaving the vulnerabilities exposed. |
| V-40858.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the Office automatic updates are enabled or disabled for all Office products installed via Click-to-Run. This policy has no effect on Office products installed via Windows Installer. If this policy setting is enabled, Office periodically checks for updates. When updates are detected, Office downloads and applies them in the background. If policy setting is disabled, Office will not check for updates. Without receiving automatic updates, vulnerabilities found within the Office products will not be applied, leaving the vulnerabilities exposed. |
| V-40858.c | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the Office automatic updates are enabled or disabled for all Office products installed via Click-to-Run. This policy has no effect on Office products installed via Windows Installer. If this policy setting is enabled, Office periodically checks for updates. When updates are detected, Office downloads and applies them in the background. If policy setting is disabled, Office will not check for updates. Without receiving automatic updates, vulnerabilities found within the Office products will not be applied, leaving the vulnerabilities exposed. |
| V-40858.d | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the Office automatic updates are enabled or disabled for all Office products installed via Click-to-Run. This policy has no effect on Office products installed via Windows Installer. If this policy setting is enabled, Office periodically checks for updates. When updates are detected, Office downloads and applies them in the background. If policy setting is disabled, Office will not check for updates. Without receiving automatic updates, vulnerabilities found within the Office products will not be applied, leaving the vulnerabilities exposed. |
| V-40859 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows the user interface (UI) options to enable or disable Office automatic updates to be hidden from users. These options are found in the Product Information area of all Office applications installed via Click-to-Run. This policy setting has no effect on Office applications installed via Windows Installer. If this policy setting is enabled, the "Enable Updates" and "Disable Updates" options in the UI are hidden from users. If this policy setting is not configured, the "Enable Updates" and "Disable Updates" options are visible, and users can enable or disable Office automatic updates from the UI. |
| V-40860 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office 365 is a subscription-based service which offers access to various Microsoft Office applications. Access to Office 365 will not be permitted; only locally installed and configured Office 2013 installations will be used. Since the ability to sign into Office 365 will be disabled, this policy, which determines whether a video about signing into Office365 is played when Office first runs, will also be disabled. |
| V-40861 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office 365 functionality allows users to provide credentials for accessing Office 365 using either their Microsoft Account, or the user ID assigned by the organization. Access to Office 365 will not be permitted; only locally installed and configured Office 2013 installations will be used. Since the ability to sign into Office 365 will be disabled, this policy, which determines whether the Office First Run comes up on first application boot if not previously viewed, will also be disabled. |
| V-40862 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office 2013 can be configured to prompt users for credentials to Office365 using either their Microsoft Account or the user ID assigned by an organization for accessing Office 365. Access to Office 365 will not be permitted and only locally installed and configured Office installations will be used. |
| V-40863 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The ability to automatically bind hyperlink to a screenshot inserted through the Insert Screenshot tool introduces the possibility of a malicious URL or website being imbedded in the Word, PowerPoint, Excel or Outlook document. Disabling the hyperlink in those screenshots will ensure users do not have the ability to directly open the hyperlinks. |
| V-40864 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is a cloud based storage feature that introduces the capability for users to save documents to locations outside of protected enclaves. This feature introduces the risk that FOUO and PII data, as well as other DoD protected data, may be inadvertently stored in a nonsecure location. This setting, which will prompt the user to sign in to OneDrive while performing a file save operation, must be disabled. |
| V-40875 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Office Presentation Service is a free, public service that allows others to follow along in a web browser. Allowing this feature could result in presentations with DoD FOUO, PII and other protected data to be viewed in a nonsecure location. By disabling this policy, the user will not have the ability to deliver a presentation online. |
| V-40879 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing online presentations to be created programmatically allows for the capability of malicious content to become imbedded in those programmatically created presentations. |
| V-40880 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Office Feedback" tool, also called "Send-a-Smile", allows a user to click on an icon and send feedback to Microsoft. The "Office Feedback" Tool must be configured to be disabled. In the event that the Office Feedback Tool has not been configured correctly as disabled, this policy configures whether the uploading of screenshots via the tool is allowed and should also be disabled. Uploading screenshots to a commercial vendor from a DoD computer may unintentionally reveal configuration and/or FOUO content. |
| V-40881 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Office Feedback" tool, also called "Send-a-Smile", allows a user to click on an icon and send feedback to Microsoft. Applications used by DoD users should not be able to provide feedback to commercial vendors regarding their positive and negative experiences when using Office due to the potential of unintentionally revealing FOUO or other protected content. |
| V-40882 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Unsecure apps for Office, which are apps that have web page or catalog locations that are not SSL-secured (https://), and/or are not in users' Internet zones may allow data to be transmitted/accessed via clear text to outside sources. By configuring this policy to be disabled, users will be prevented from transmitting/accessing data in a nonsecure manner. |
| V-40883 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows users to be prevented from using or inserting apps that come from the Office Store. If this policy setting is enabled, apps from the Office Store are blocked. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, apps from the Office Store are allowed, unless the "Block Apps for Office" policy setting is enabled. |
| V-40884 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft Office includes the ability to roam settings for specific Office features amongst devices by storing this data in the cloud. This data includes user activity such as the list of most recently used documents as well as user preferences such as the Office theme. This policy setting controls whether this data is allowed to be stored in the cloud. If this policy setting is enabled, roaming settings are only stored locally and not synchronized to the Microsoft Office roaming settings web service. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, roaming settings are synchronized with the Microsoft Office roaming settings web service and users can access their data from other devices. Existing data in the cloud is not affected by this policy. |
| V-40885 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office Telemetry is a new compatibility monitoring framework. When an Office document or solution is loaded, used, closed, or raises an error in certain Office 2013 applications, the Office Telemetry application adds a record about the event to a local data store. Each record includes a description of the problem and a link to more information. Inventory and usage data is also tracked. The actual logging capability will be enabled, but this policy allows that data to be uploaded to a remote location which, if enabled, could pass information about the internal network and configuration to that remote site. |
| V-40886 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures the Office Telemetry Agent to disguise, or obfuscate, certain file properties that are reported in telemetry data. If this policy setting is enabled, Office Telemetry Agent obfuscates the file name, file path, and title of Office documents before uploading telemetry data to the shared folder. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, the Office Telemetry Agent uploads telemetry data that shows the full file name, file path, and title of all Office documents. |
| V-40887 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office Telemetry is a new compatibility monitoring framework. When an Office document or solution is loaded, used, closed, or raises an error in certain Office 2013 applications, the Office Telemetry application adds a record about the event to a local data store. Each record includes a description of the problem and a link to more information. Inventory and usage data is also tracked. This policy setting allows the data collection features in Office that are used by the Office Telemetry Dashboard and Office Telemetry Log to be turned on. If this policy setting is enabled, Office Telemetry Agent and Office applications will collect telemetry data, which includes Office application usage, most recently used Office documents (including file names) and solutions usage, compatibility issues, and critical errors that occur on the local computers. Office Telemetry Dashboard can be used to view this data remotely, and users can use Office Telemetry Log to view this data on their local computers. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, the Office Telemetry Agent and Office applications do not generate or collect telemetry data. |

**Description:** The Microsoft Office System 2016 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. The requirements are derived from the NIST 800-53 and related documents. Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via e-mail to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-70855 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the Help Improve Proofing Tools feature sends usage data to Microsoft. The Help Improve Proofing Tools feature collects data about use of the Proofing Tools, such as additions to the custom dictionary, and sends it to Microsoft. After about six months, the feature stops sending data to Microsoft and deletes the data collection file from the user's computer. If you enable this policy setting, this feature is enabled if users choose to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). If your organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as the CEIP, allowing the use of the Help Improve Proofing Tools feature might cause them to violate these policies. If you disable this policy setting, the Help Improve Proofing Tools feature does not collect proofing tool usage information and transmit it to Microsoft. If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of setting the policy to "Enabled".  |
| V-70859 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Office 2016 applications notify users when potentially unsafe features or content are detected, or whether such features or content are silently disabled without notification. The Message Bar in Office 2016 applications is used to identify security issues, such as unsigned macros or potentially unsafe add-ins. When such issues are detected, the application disables the unsafe feature or content and displays the Message Bar at the top of the active window. The Message Bar informs the users about the nature of the security issue and, in some cases, provides the users with an option to enable the potentially unsafe feature or content, which could harm the user's computer. If you enable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications do not display information in the Message Bar about potentially unsafe content that has been detected or has automatically been blocked. If you disable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications display information in the Message Bar about content that has automatically been blocked. If you do not configure this policy setting, if an Office 2016 application detects a security issue, the Message Bar is displayed. However, this configuration can be modified by users in the Trust Center.  |
| V-70861 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether metadata is encrypted in Office Open XML files that are protected by Information Rights Management (IRM). If you enable this policy setting, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word encrypt metadata stored in rights-managed Office Open XML files and override any configuration changes on users' computers. If you disable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications cannot encrypt metadata in rights-managed Office Open XML files, which can reduce security. If you do not configure this policy setting, when Information Rights Management (IRM) is used to restrict access to an Office Open XML document, any metadata associated with the document is not encrypted.  |
| V-70863 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether metadata is encrypted when an Office Open XML file is password protected. If you enable this policy setting, Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, and Word 2016 encrypt metadata stored in password-protected Office Open XML files and override any configuration changes on users' computers. If you disable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications cannot encrypt metadata in password-protected Office Open XML files, which can reduce security. If you do not configure this policy setting, when an Office Open XML document is protected with a password and saved, any metadata associated with the document is encrypted along with the rest of the document's contents. If this configuration is changed, potentially sensitive information such as the document author and hyperlink references could be exposed to unauthorized people.  |
| V-70865 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to specify an encryption type for Office Open XML files. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the type of encryption that Office applications use to encrypt password-protected files in the Office Open XML file formats used by Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. The chosen encryption type must have a corresponding cryptographic service provider (CSP) installed on the computer that encrypts the file. See the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider\ registry key for a list of CSPs installed on the local computer. Specify the encryption type to use by entering it in the provided text box in the following form:<Encryption Provider>,<Encryption Algorithm>,<Encryption Key Length>For example: Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0,RC4,128. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the default CSP is used. The default cryptographic service provider (CSP) is Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider, AES-128, 128-bit.Note: This policy setting does not take effect unless the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\<office application name>\Security\Crypto\CompatMode is set to 0. By default the CompatMode registry key is set to 1.  |
| V-70867 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting enables you to specify an encryption type for password-protected Office 97-2003 files. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the type of encryption that Office applications will use to encrypt password-protected files in the older Office 97-2003 file formats. The chosen encryption type must have a corresponding cryptographic service provider (CSP) installed on the computer that encrypts the file. See the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider\ registry key for a list of CSPs installed on the local computer. Specify the encryption type to use by entering it in the provided text box in the following form:<Encryption Provider>,<Encryption Algorithm>,<Encryption Key Length>.For example, Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0,RC4,128. If you do not configure this policy setting, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word use Office 97/2000 Compatible encryption, a proprietary encryption method, to encrypt password-protected Office 97-2003 files.  |
| V-70869.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting specifies the Microsoft ActiveX« initialization security level for all Microsoft Office applications. ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. To indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe For Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates that a control is safe to open and run, and that it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible that the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean that the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future. If you enable this policy setting, you can set the ActiveX security level to a number between 1 and 6. These security levels are as follows: 1 - Regardless of how the control is marked, load it and use the persisted values (if any). This setting does not prompt the user. 2 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, load in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or use the default (first-time initialization) settings. This level is similar to the default configuration, but does not prompt the user. 3 - If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings. 4 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings. 5 - If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values. 6 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, if a control is marked SFI, the application loads the control in safe mode and uses persisted values (if any). If the control is not marked SFI, the application loads the control in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or uses the default (first-time initialization) settings. In both situations, the Message Bar informs users that the controls have been disabled and prompts them to respond. Important - Some ActiveX controls do not respect the safe mode registry setting, and therefore might load persisted data even though you configure this setting to instruct the control to use safe mode. This setting only increases security for ActiveX controls that are accurately marked as SFI. In situations that involve malicious or poorly designed code, an ActiveX control might be inaccurately marked as SFI.  |

| V-70871.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to control how ActiveX controls in UserForms should be initialized based upon whether they are Safe For Initialization (SFI) or Unsafefor Initialization (UFI). ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization (SFI), which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer--or it's possible the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date.SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety wasn't important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for loading controls in UserForms: 1- For a UFI or SFI signed control that supports safe and unsafe mode, load the control in unsafe mode. For an SFI signed control that only supports a safe mode configuration, load the control in safe mode. This option enforces the default configuration. 2 - Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: - For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control using the default properties. - For an SFI signed control that supports both safe and unsafe modes, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control using safe mode. If the SFI control can only support safe mode, load the control in safe mode. This option is the default configuration in the Microsoft Office 2016 release. 3 - Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: - For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control with its default properties. - For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode. 4 - For a UFI signed control, load with the default properties of the control. For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode (considered to be the safest mode). If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is as if you enable this policy setting and then select option 1.  |

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is as if you enable this policy setting and then select option 1.  |
| V-70873 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether macros can run in an Office 2016 application that is opened programmatically by another application. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options for controlling macro behavior in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word when the application is opened programmatically: - Disable macros by default - All macros are disabled in the programmatically opened application. - Macros enabled (default) - Macros can run in the programmatically opened application. This option enforces the default configuration in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. - User application macro security level - Macro functionality is determined by the setting in the "Macro Settings" section of the Trust Center. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when a separate program is used to launch Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, or Word programmatically, any macros can run in the programmatically opened application without being blocked.  |
| V-70875 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether trusted locations can be defined by users, the Office Customization Tool (OCT), and Group Policy, or if they must be defined by Group Policy alone. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify any location as a trusted location, and a computer can have a combination of user-created, OCT-created, and Group Policy-created trusted locations. If you disable this policy setting, all trusted locations that are not created by Group Policy are disabled and users cannot create new trusted locations in the Trust Center. If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of setting the policy to Enabled. Note - InfoPath 2016 and Outlook 2016 do not recognize trusted locations, and therefore are unaffected by this policy setting.  |
| V-70877 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether Office 2016 applications can load an XML expansion pack manifest file with a Smart Document. An XML expansion pack is the group of files that constitutes a Smart Document in Excel and Word. You package one or more components that provide the logic needed for a Smart Document by using an XML expansion pack. These components can include any type of file, including XML schemas, Extensible Stylesheet Language Transforms (XSLTs), dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), and image files, as well as additional XML files, HTML files, Word files, Excel files, and text files. The key component to building an XML expansion pack is creating an XML expansion pack manifest file. By creating this file, you specify the locations of all files that make up the XML expansion pack, as well as information that instructs Office 2016 how to set up the files for your Smart Document. The XML expansion pack can also contain information about how to set up some files, such as how to install and register a COM object required by the XML expansion pack. If you enable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications cannot load XML expansion packs with Smart Documents. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Office 2016 applications can load an XML expansion pack manifest file with a Smart Document.  |
| V-70881 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether users are required to connect to the Internet or a local network to have their licenses confirmed every time they attempt to open Excel workbooks, InfoPath forms or templates, Outlook e-mail messages, PowerPoint presentations, or Word documents that are protected by Information Rights Management (IRM). This policy is useful if you want to log the usage of files with restricted permissions on the server. If you enable this policy setting, users are required to connect to verify permissions. This policy setting will only affect protected files created on machines where the policy is enabled. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users are not required to connect to the network to verify permissions.  |
| V-70883 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether document metadata can be saved in PDF and XPS documents. If you enable this policy setting, document properties metadata is not exported to PDF and XPS files. If you disable this policy setting, document properties metadata will always be saved with PDF and XPS files, and users will not be able to override this configuration. If you do not configure this policy setting, if the Microsoft Save as PDF or XPS Add-in for Microsoft Office Programs add-in is installed, document properties are saved as metadata when users save files using the PDF or XPS or Publish as PDF or XPS commands in Access, Excel, InfoPath, PowerPoint, and Word, unless the "Document properties" option is unchecked in the Options dialog.  |
| V-70885 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you configure if the document properties are encrypted. This applies to OLE documents (Office 97-2003 compatible) if the application is configured for CAPI RC4. If you enable this policy setting, the document properties will be encrypted. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the document properties will not be encrypted.  |
| V-70889 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to remove Office Presentation Service from the list of online presentation services in PowerPoint and Word. This list appears when a user selects Present Online from the Share tab in Backstage view and in the ribbon in PowerPoint. If you enable this policy setting, Office Presentation Service is not shown as an option for presenting online. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can select Office Presentation Service to present their PowerPoint or Word file to other users online.  |
| V-70891 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to restrict the ability to create an online presentation programmatically in PowerPoint and Word. If you enable this policy setting, an online presentation cannot be created programmatically. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, an online presentation can be created programmatically.  |
| V-70893 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting manages whether the Office Feedback Tool (a.k.a. Send a Smile) allows the user to send a screenshot of their desktop with their feedback to Microsoft. The Office Feedback Tool allows users to provide Microsoft feedback regarding their positive and negative experiences when using Office. If you enable this policy setting, the Office Feedback Tool will allow the user to send a screenshot of their desktop with their feedback to Microsoft. If you disable this policy setting, the Office Feedback Tool will not allow the user to send a screenshot of their desktop with their feedback to Microsoft. If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of setting the policy to "Enabled".  |
| V-70895 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows users to run unsecure web add-in, which are add-ins that have web page or catalog locations that are not SSL-secured (https://), and are not in users' Internet zones. If you enable this policy setting, users can run unsecure apps. To enable specific unsecure web add-ins, you must also configure the Trusted Web add-in Catalog policy settings to trust the catalogs that contains those Add-ins. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, unsecure web add-ins are not allowed.  |
| V-70897 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures Office Telemetry Agent to disguise, or obfuscate, certain file properties that are reported in telemetry data. If you enable this policy setting, Office Telemetry Agent obfuscates the file name, file path, and title of Office documents before uploading telemetry data to the shared folder. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Office Telemetry Agent uploads telemetry data that shows the full file name, file path, and title of all Office documents.  |
| V-70899 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether users can send personal information to Office. When users choose to send information Office 2016 applications automatically send information to Office. If you enable this policy setting, users will opt into sending personal information to Office. If your organization has policies that govern the use of external resources, opting users into the program might cause them to violate these policies. If you disable this policy setting, Office 2016 users cannot send personal information to Office. If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of setting the policy to "Enabled".  |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-17173 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous web pages, which could pose a security risk. |
| V-17174 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-17175 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run. |
| V-17183 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur. |
| V-17184 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk. |
| V-17187 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If an application is configured to require all add-ins to be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message informing users about the unsigned add-in. If a user is allowed to make the determination to allow an unsigned add-in, it increases the risk of malicious code being introduced onto the user's computer or the network. |
| V-17471 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Trusted locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures and could harm users' computers or data. By default, files located in trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) are assumed to be safe. |
| V-17473 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When an Office Open XML document (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) is rights-managed, or password-protected, any macros embedded in the document are encrypted along with the rest of the contents. By default, these encrypted macros will be disabled unless they are scanned by antivirus software immediately before being loaded. If this default configuration is modified, Office products will not require encrypted macros to be scanned before loading. They will be handled as specified by the Office System macro security settings, which can cause macro viruses to load undetected and lead to data loss or reduced application functionality. |
| V-17520 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Files located in Trusted Locations and specified in the Trust Center are typically assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from Trusted Locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. By default, users can specify Trusted Locations on network shares, or in other remote locations not under their direct control, by selecting the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network" (not recommended) check box in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to typical security measures and could affect users' computers or data. |
| V-17521 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users create new document files, Word 2013 saves them in the new Word 2013 .docx format. Ensure this setting is enabled to specify that all new files are created in Word 2013. If a new document is created in an earlier format, some users may not be able to open or use the file, or they may choose a format this is less secure than the Word 2013 format. Users can still select a specific format when they save files, but they cannot change default of this setting from the Word Options dialog box. This enforced user behavior ensures any change to the file format requires additional deliberate user interaction. |
| V-17522 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | STO projects require access to the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, even though the projects do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Design-time support of controls in both Visual Basic and C# projects depends on the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Word and Excel. By default, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint do not allow automation clients to have programmatic access to VBA projects. Users can enable this by selecting the Trust access to the VBA project object model in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. However, doing so allows macros in any documents the user opens to access the core Visual Basic objects, methods, and properties, which represents a potential security hazard. |
| V-17545 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users open files containing VBA macros, applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users may then enable these macros by clicking Options on the Trust Bar and selecting the option to enable them. Disabling or not configuring this setting may allow dangerous macros to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-17811 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users open documents Word automatically updates any links to external content, such as graphics, Excel worksheets, and PowerPoint slides. To disable automatic updating, the user can click the Office Button, click Word Options, click Advanced, scroll to the General section, and then clear the Update automatic links at open check box. If Word is configured to automatically update links when documents are open, document content can change without the user's knowledge, which could put important information at risk. |
| V-17813 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Tracked changes or comments embedded within a document may contain sensitive, insulting, or embarrassing information that the document owner forgot, or that a contributor may have inserted. |
| V-26584 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers. |
| V-26585 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26586 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26588 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-26589 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office 2013 applications do not check the digital signature on application add-ins before opening them. Disabling or not configuring this setting may allow an application to load a dangerous add-in. As a result, malicious code could become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26592 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office File Validation helps detect and prevent a kind of exploit known as a file format attack or file fuzzing attack. File format attacks exploit the integrity of a file. They occur when someone modifies the structure of a file with the intent of adding malicious code. Usually the malicious code is run remotely and is used to elevate the privilege of restricted accounts on the computer. As a result, an attacker could gain access to a computer that they did not previously have access to. This could enable an attacker to read sensitive information from the computer's hard disk drive or install malware, such as a worm or a key logging program. The Office File Validation feature helps prevent file format attacks by scanning and validating files before they are opened. To validate files, Office File Validation compares a file's structure to a predefined file schema, which is a set of rules that determine what a readable file looks like. If Office File Validation detects that a file's structure does not follow all rules that are described in the schema, the file does not pass validation. |
| V-26612 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users can open, view, or edit a large number of file types in Office 2013. Some file types are safer than others, as some could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. For this reason, disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network. |
| V-26614 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining if files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. |
| V-26615 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines if files located in unsafe locations will open in Protected View. If unsafe locations have not been specified, only the "Downloaded Program Files" and "Temporary Internet Files" folders are considered unsafe locations. If enabling this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations open in Protected View. |
| V-26616.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy key controls the behavior of how Office documents should be handled when failing file validation. By requiring such documents to be opened in Protected View, any potentially malicious code would be disabled, allowing the user to edit the document and resaved correctly. |
| V-26616.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy key controls the behavior of how Office documents should be handled when failing file validation. By requiring such documents to be opened in Protected View, any potentially malicious code would be disabled, allowing the user to edit the document and resaved correctly. |
| V-26617 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining if Word files in Outlook attachments open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, Outlook attachments do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, Outlook attachments open in Protected View. |
| V-26648 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting allows you to prevent online dictionaries from being used for the translation of text through the Research pane. |
| V-26653 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save Word files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur during between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26654 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling the editing of the specified format in protected view, it mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur during between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26656 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save Word files saved in the specified format. Enabling block of the specified format mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur during between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26657 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling the editing of the specified format in protected view, it mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur during between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26658 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling the editing of the specified format in protected view, it mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur during between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-26659 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting specifies whether users can open, view, edit, or save files saved in the specified format. Enabling the editing of the specified format in protected view, it mitigates zero-day security attacks (which are attacks that occur during between the time that a vulnerability becomes publicly known and a software update or service pack is available) by temporarily preventing users from opening specific types of files and to prevent a user from opening files that have been saved in earlier and pre-release (beta) Microsoft Office formats. |
| V-41147 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting specifies how Word behaves when opening a document that contains custom XML markup. Versions of Word that are distributed by Microsoft after January 10, 2010 no longer read the custom XML markup that may be contained within (.docx, .docm, .dotx, .dotm or .xml files. The new versions of Word 2007, Word 2010, and Word 2013 can still open these files, but any custom XML markup is removed. Configuring this setting will prompt the user with a warning, notifying of the lost of the XML markup. While this is the default setting, explicitly configuring the setting will ensure users are prompted. |
| V-72829 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to block macros from running in Office files that come from the Internet. If you enable this policy setting, macros are blocked from running, even if 'Enable all macro's is selected in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. Also, instead of having the choice to 'Enable Content', users will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. If the Office file is saved to a trusted location or was previously trusted by the user, macros will be allowed to run. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the settings configured in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center determine whether macros run in Office files that come from the Internet. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-71041 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a website). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous Web pages, which could pose a security risk. |
| V-71043 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine if users can open, view, or edit Word files. If you enable this policy setting, you can set one of these options:- Blocked files are not opened- Blocked files open in Protected View and can not be edited- Blocked files open in Protected View and can be edited. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the same as the "Blocked files are not opened" setting. Users will not be able to open blocked files.  |
| V-71045 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load. |
| V-71047 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run.  |
| V-71049 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to turn off the file validation feature. If you enable this policy setting, file validation will be turned off. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, file validation will be turned on. Office Binary Documents (97-2003) are checked to see if they conform against the file format schema before they are opened.  |
| V-71051 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining if files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files downloaded from the Internet zone open in Protected View.  |
| V-71053 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | To protect users from attacks, Internet Explorer usually does not attempt to load malformed URLs. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer attempts to load a malformed URL, a security risk could occur.  |
| V-71055 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malicious websites often try to confuse or trick users into giving a site permission to perform an action allowing the site to take control of the users' computers in some manner. Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to: -Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system. -Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input. -Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices or prompts. |
| V-71057 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer add-ons are pieces of code, run in Internet Explorer, to provide additional functionality. Rogue add-ons may contain viruses or other malicious code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network. For example, a malicious user can monitor and then use keystrokes users type into Internet Explorer. Even legitimate add-ons may demand resources, compromising the performance of Internet Explorer, and the operating systems for user computers.  |
| V-71059 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether add-ins for this applications must be digitally signed by a trusted publisher. If you enable this policy setting, this application checks the digital signature for each add-in before loading it. If an add-in does not have a digital signature, or if the signature did not come from a trusted publisher, this application disables the add-in and notifies the user. Certificates must be added to the Trusted Publishers list if you require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher. For detail on about obtaining and distributing certificates, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294922. Office 2016 stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Office 2016 still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Office and you upgrade to Office 2016, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. For more information about trusted publishers, see the Office Resource Kit. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, this application does not check the digital signature on application add-ins before opening them. If a dangerous add-in is loaded, it could harm users' computers or compromise data security.  |
| V-71061 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Pop-up Blocker feature in Internet Explorer can be used to block most unwanted pop-up and pop-under windows from appearing. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If the Pop-up Blocker is disabled, disruptive and potentially dangerous pop-up windows could load and present a security risk.  |
| V-71063 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether the specified Office application notifies users when unsigned application add-ins are loaded or silently disable such add-ins without notification. This policy setting only applies if you enable the "Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher" policy setting, which prevents users from changing this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, applications automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users. If you disable this policy setting, if this application is configured to require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message that informs users about the unsigned add-in. If you do not configure this policy setting, the disable behavior applies, and in addition, users can configure this requirement themselves in the "Add-ins" category of the Trust Center for the application.  |
| V-71065 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | abling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file. If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71067 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows administrators to disable all trusted locations in the specified applications. Trusted locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations that are assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures and could harm users' computers or data. If you enable this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are ignored, including any trusted locations established by Office 2016 during setup, deployed to users using Group Policy, or added by users themselves. Users will be prompted again when opening files from trusted locations. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are assumed to be safe.  |
| V-71069 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the "Add new location" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers. Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center. We recommended that you do not enable this policy setting (as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box also states). Therefore, in practice, it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users. If you do not enable this policy setting, users can select the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box if desired and then specify trusted locations by clicking the "Add new location" button.  |
| V-71071 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines the default file format for saving files in Word. If you enable this policy setting, you can set the default file format from among the following options: - Word Document (*.docx): This option is the default configuration in Word.- Single Files Web Page (*.mht)- Web Page (*.htm; *.html)- Web Page, Filtered (*.htm, *.html)- Rich Text Format (*.rtf)- Plain Text (*.txt)- Word 6.0/95 (*.doc)- Word 6.0/95 - Chinese (Simplified) (*.doc)- Word 6.0/95 - Chinese (Traditional) (*.doc)- Word 6.0/95 - Japanese (*.doc)- Word 6.0/95 - Korean (*.doc)- Word 97-2002 and 6.0/95 - RTF- Word 5.1 for Macintosh (*.mcw)- Word 5.0 for Macintosh (*.mcw)- Word 2.x for Windows (*.doc)- Works 4.0 for Windows (*.wps)- WordPerfect 5.x for Windows (*.doc)- WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS (*.doc)- Word Macro-Enabled Document (*.docm)- Word Template (*.dotx)- Word Macro-Enabled Template (*.dotm)- Word 97 - 2003 Document (*.doc)- Word 97 - 2003 Template (*.dot)- Word XML Document (*.xml)- Strict Open XML Document (*.docx)- OpenDocument Text (*.odt). Users can choose to save presentations or documents in a different file format than the default. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Word saves new files in the Office Open XML format: Word files have a .docx extension. For users who run recent versions of Word, Microsoft offers the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, which enables them to open and save Office Open XML files. If some users in your organization cannot install the Compatibility Pack, or are running versions of Word older than Microsoft Office 2000 with Service Pack 3, they might not be able to access Office Open XML files. This policy setting is often set in combination with the "Save As Open XML in Compatibility Mode" policy setting.  |
| V-71073 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether encrypted macros in Open XML documents be are required to be scanned with anti-virus software before being opened. If you enable this policy setting, you may choose one of these options:- Scan encrypted macros: encrypted macros are disabled unless anti-virus software is installed. Encrypted macros are scanned by your anti-virus software when you attempt to open an encrypted workbook that contains macros.- Scan if anti-virus software available: if anti-virus software is installed, scan the encrypted macros first before allowing them to load. If anti-virus software is not available, allow encrypted macros to load.- Load macros without scanning: do not check for anti-virus software and allow macros to be loaded in an encrypted file. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior will be similar to the "Scan encrypted macros" option.  |
| V-71075 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls whether automation clients such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Microsoft Office (VSTO) can access the Visual Basic for Applications project system in the specified applications. VSTO projects require access to the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, even though the projects do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Design-time support of controls in both Visual Basic and C# projects depends on the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Word and Excel. If you enable this policy setting, VSTO and other automation clients can access the Visual Basic for Applications project system in the specified applications. Users will not be able to change this behavior through the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" user interface option under the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. If you disable this policy setting, VSTO does not have programmatic access to VBA projects. In addition, the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" check box is cleared and users cannot change it. Note: Disabling this policy setting prevents VSTO projects from interacting properly with the VBA project system in the selected application. If you do not configure this policy setting, automation clients do not have programmatic access to VBA projects. Users can enable this by selecting the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" in the "Macro Settings" section of the Trust Center. However, doing so allows macros in any documents the user opens to access the core Visual Basic objects, methods, and properties, which represents a potential security hazard.  |
| V-71077 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each web page users can use the browser to open. Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges. This could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71079 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft ActiveX controls allow unmanaged, unprotected code to run on the user computers. ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls. Disabling or not configuring this setting does not block prompts for ActiveX control installations, and these prompts display to users. This could allow malicious code to become active on user computers or the network.  |
| V-71081 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting determines whether files located in unsafe locations will open in Protected View. If unsafe locations have not been specified, only the "Downloaded Program Files" and "Temporary Internet Files" folders are considered unsafe locations. If enabling this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, files located in unsafe locations open in Protected View.  |
| V-71083.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Office handles documents when they fail file validation. If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the following options for files that fail file validation:- Block files completely. Users cannot open the files.- Open files in Protected View and disallow edit. Users cannot edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you disable this policy setting.- Open files in Protected View and allow edit. Users can edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you do not configure this policy setting.If you disable this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and disallow edit" behavior. If you do not configure this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and allow edit" behavior.  |
| V-71083.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how Office handles documents when they fail file validation. If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the following options for files that fail file validation:- Block files completely. Users cannot open the files.- Open files in Protected View and disallow edit. Users cannot edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you disable this policy setting.- Open files in Protected View and allow edit. Users can edit the files. This is also how Office handles the files if you do not configure this policy setting.If you disable this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and disallow edit" behavior. If you do not configure this policy setting, Office follows the "Open files in Protected View and allow edit" behavior.  |
| V-71085 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows for determining whether Word files in Outlook attachments open in Protected View. If enabling this policy setting, Outlook attachments do not open in Protected View. If disabling or not configuring this policy setting, Outlook attachments open in Protected View.  |
| V-71087 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When users open documents Word automatically updates any links to external content, such as graphics, Excel worksheets, and PowerPoint slides. To disable automatic updating, the user can click the Office Button, click Word Options, click Advanced, scroll to the General section, and then clear the Update automatic links at open check box. If Word is configured to automatically update links when documents are open, document content can change without the user's knowledge, which could put important information at risk. |
| V-71089 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. If you disable this policy setting, "Disable all with notification" will be the default setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar. If the user clicks "Enable Content", then the document is added as a trusted document. Important: If "Disable all except digitally signed macros" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases. Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Microsoft Office and you upgrade to Office, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store.  |
| V-71091 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to prevent online dictionaries from being used for the translation of text through the Research pane. If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, the online dictionaries can be used to translate text through the Research pane. If you disable this policy setting, the online dictionaries cannot be used to translate text through the Research pane.  |
| V-71093 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to determine whether users can open, view, edit, or save Word files with the format specified by the title of this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify whether users can open, view, edit, or save files.The options that can be selected are below. Note: Not all options may be available for this policy setting.- Do not block: The file type will not be blocked.- Save blocked: Saving of the file type will be blocked.- Open/Save blocked, use open policy: Both opening and saving of the file type will be blocked.

| V-66723.a | FileContentRule | KeyValuePairFile | Certificates may be revoked due to improper issuance, compromise of the certificate, and failure to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found revoked on a CRL or via Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) should not be trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a revoked certificate may result in spoofing, malware, system modification, invasion of privacy, and denial of service. Ensuring users cannot change these settings assures a more consistent security profile. |

| V-66941.a | FileContentRule | KeyValuePairFile | The deployment.config configuration file contains two keys. The "deployment.properties" key includes the path of the "deployment.properties" file and the "deployment.properties.mandatory" key contains either a TRUE or FALSE value. If the path specified to "deployment.properties" does not lead to a "deployment.properties" file, the value of the “deployment.system.config.mandatory” key determines how JRE will handle the situation. If the value of the "deployment.system.config.mandatory" key is TRUE and if the path to the "deployment.properties" file is invalid, the JRE will not allow Java applications to run. This is the desired behavior. |

| V-66955.a | FileContentRule | KeyValuePairFile | ecisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the system if used maliciously. Mobile code is defined as software modules obtained from remote systems, transferred across a network, and then downloaded and executed on a local system without explicit installation or execution by the recipient. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed, downloaded, or executed on all endpoints (e.g., servers, workstations, and smart phones). This requirement applies to applications that execute, evaluate, or otherwise process mobile code (e.g., web applications, browsers, and anti-virus applications). |

| V-41402 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., network interface, hard disk, modem, etc.). From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records. Examples are auditable events, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Organizations define which application components shall provide auditable events. The DBMS must provide auditing for the list of events defined by the organization or risk negatively impacting forensic investigations into malicious behavior in the information system. |
| V-41407 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | SQL Server database ownership is a higher level privilege that grants full rights to everything in that database, including the right to grant privileges to others. SQL Server requires that the owner of a database object be a user, and only one user can be the assigned owner of a database object. This tends to minimize the risk that multiple users could gain unauthorized access, except the one individual who is the owner. Within the database, object ownership implies full privileges to the owned object, including the privilege to assign access to the owned objects to other subjects. Unmanaged or uncontrolled ownership of databases can lead to unauthorized granting of privileges and database alterations. |

| V-40950 | PermissionRule | FileSystemAuditRuleEntry | Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals are allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Examples of access restrictions include: physical access controls (such as locks and access cards), logical access controls (such as ACLs), automated auditing (logging) of logical access, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes are implemented into a third-party interface rather than directly into the information system component), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). This requirement focuses on the auditing aspect of the protections. |
| V-69169 | PermissionRule | FileSystemAuditRuleEntry | When dealing with change control issues, it should be noted, any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of applications and tools related to SQL Server can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. Only qualified and authorized individuals shall be allowed to obtain access to components related to SQL Server for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Unmanaged changes that occur to the software libraries or configuration can lead to unauthorized or compromised installations. Of particular note in this context is that any software installed for auditing and/or audit file management must be protected and audited. |
| V-40936 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | SQL Server's 'sa' account has special privileges required to administer the database. The 'sa' account is a well-known SQL Server account and is likely to be targeted by attackers and thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. This 'sa' default account is administrative and could lead to catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. If the 'sa' default account is not disabled, an attacker might be able to gain access through the account. SQL Server by default, at installation, disables the 'sa' account. Some applications that run on SQL Server require the 'sa' account to be enabled in order for the application to function properly. These applications that require the 'sa' account to be enabled are usually legacy systems. |
| V-40942 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. Examples include, but are not limited to, installing advertising software, demonstrations, or browser plug-ins not related to requirements and providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but which cannot be disabled. Applications must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing only essential capabilities. Even though the very popular "AdventureWorks" database is no longer available by default, it introduces a vulnerability to SQL Server and must be removed. Demonstration and sample database objects and applications present publicly known attack points for malicious users. These demonstration and sample objects are meant to provide simple examples of coding specific functions and are not developed to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced to the SQL Server and the OS. |

| V-41021 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Detection of suspicious activity, including access attempts and successful access from unexpected places, during unexpected times, or other unusual indicators, can support decisions to apply countermeasures to deter an attack. Without detection, malicious activity may proceed without hindrance. In SQL Server's case, this is a combination of the standard audit trace, as well as the operating system logs. Only the SQL Server logs are validated for this check, as the other part is dependent upon the operating system. |
| V-41022 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | It is critical that, when SQL Server is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. If the system were to continue processing without auditing enabled, actions could be taken on the system that could not be tracked and recorded for later forensic analysis. In many system configurations, the disk space allocated to the auditing system is separate from the disks allocated for the operating system; therefore, this may not result in a system outage. This places the onus on the DBMS to detect and take actions. A failure of SQL Server auditing will result in either the database continuing to function without auditing, or the halting of SQL Server operations. In this case, the database must cease processing immediately in order to not allow unlogged transaction to occur. Note that trace file rollover does not count as an audit failure, provided that the system is also configured to shut down when it runs out of space. Trace file rollover can be a useful technique for breaking the log into manageable pieces, for archiving, or for transfer to a log management system. |
| V-41024 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Configure SQL Server during the installation and/or configuration process to determine if adequate storage capacity has been allocated for audit logs. If SQL Server audit logs that are being generated exceed the amount of space reserved for those logs, the system may shutdown or take other measures to stop processing in order to protect transactions from continuing unlogged. After the initial setup of SQL Server audit log configuration, it is best to check the available space frequently until the maximum number of files has been reached. Checking the available space can help determine the balance of online audit data with space required. |
| V-41027 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | SQL Server auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server does have a means available to add organizationally defined additional, more detailed information in the audit event records. These events may be identified by type, location, or subject. An example of more detailed information the organization may require in audit records could be the name of the application where the request is coming from. Some organizations may determine that more detailed information is required for specific database event types. If this information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events. |
| V-41028 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Database software is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly who performed a given action. If user identification information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. |
| V-41029 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know the outcome of attempted actions. This requires specific information regarding the outcome of the action or event that the audit record is referring to. If outcome status information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. Success and failure indicators ascertain the outcome of a particular event. As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Without knowing the outcome of audit events, it is very difficult to accurately recreate the series of events during forensic analysis. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the outcome status-specific information in all audit records. |
| V-41030 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly who performed what actions. This requires specific information regarding the source of the event an audit record is referring to. If the source of the event information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. The source of the event can be a user account and sometimes a system account when timed jobs are run. Without information establishing the source of activity, the value of audit records from a forensics perspective is questionable. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the source of the event-specific information in all audit records. |
| V-41031 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis.

If event location information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. An event location can be a database instance, table, column, row, etc. Without sufficient information establishing where the audit events occurred, investigation into the cause of events is severely hindered. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the event location-specific information in all audit records. |

| V-41035 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system, such as network interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited, as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked). Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components shall provide auditable events. Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the SQL Server configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability. |
| V-41037 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | SQL Server's 'sa' account has special privileges required to administer the database. The 'sa' account is a well-known SQL Server account name and is likely to be targeted by attackers, and is thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. Since the SQL Server 'sa' is administrative in nature, the compromise of a default account can have catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. Since SQL Server needs for this account to exist and it should not be removed, one way to mitigate this risk is to change the 'sa' account name. |

| V-41278 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | The concept of least privilege must be applied to SQL Server processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions and/or functions.

| V-41305 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, they often attempt to create a persistent method of re-establishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to modify an existing account for later use. Notification of account creation is one method and best practice for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail which documents the creation of application user accounts and notifies administrators and/or application owners exist. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes. To address the multitude of policy based access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to off-load those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. |

One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to simply modify an existing account. Auditing of account modification is one method and best practice for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive application account management process ensures an audit trail automatically documents the modification of application user accounts and, as required, notifies administrators, application owners, and/or appropriate individuals. Applications must provide this capability directly, leverage complimentary technology providing this capability, or a combination thereof.

| V-41307 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these internetworking mechanisms is private or secure, and they do not by default restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established. Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations post security incident.  |

**Description:** The Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via e-mail to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-40950 | PermissionRule | FileSystemAuditRuleEntry | Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals are allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Examples of access restrictions include: physical access controls (such as locks and access cards), logical access controls (such as ACLs), automated auditing (logging) of logical access, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes are implemented into a third-party interface rather than directly into the information system component), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). This requirement focuses on the auditing aspect of the protections. |
| V-69169 | PermissionRule | FileSystemAuditRuleEntry | When dealing with change control issues, it should be noted, any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of applications and tools related to SQL Server can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. Only qualified and authorized individuals shall be allowed to obtain access to components related to SQL Server for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Unmanaged changes that occur to the software libraries or configuration can lead to unauthorized or compromised installations. Of particular note in this context is that any software installed for auditing and/or audit file management must be protected and audited. |
| V-40936 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | SQL Server's 'sa' account has special privileges required to administer the database. The 'sa' account is a well-known SQL Server account and is likely to be targeted by attackers and thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. This 'sa' default account is administrative and could lead to catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. If the 'sa' default account is not disabled, an attacker might be able to gain access through the account. SQL Server by default, at installation, disables the 'sa' account. Some applications that run on SQL Server require the 'sa' account to be enabled in order for the application to function properly. These applications that require the 'sa' account to be enabled are usually legacy systems. |
| V-40942 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. Examples include, but are not limited to, installing advertising software, demonstrations, or browser plug-ins not related to requirements and providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but which cannot be disabled. Applications must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing only essential capabilities. Even though the very popular "AdventureWorks" database is no longer available by default, it introduces a vulnerability to SQL Server and must be removed. Demonstration and sample database objects and applications present publicly known attack points for malicious users. These demonstration and sample objects are meant to provide simple examples of coding specific functions and are not developed to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced to the SQL Server and the OS. |

These demonstration and sample objects are meant to provide simple examples of coding specific functions and are not developed to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced to the SQL Server and the OS. |
| V-41021 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Detection of suspicious activity, including access attempts and successful access from unexpected places, during unexpected times, or other unusual indicators, can support decisions to apply countermeasures to deter an attack. Without detection, malicious activity may proceed without hindrance. In SQL Server's case, this is a combination of the standard audit trace, as well as the operating system logs. Only the SQL Server logs are validated for this check, as the other part is dependent upon the operating system. |
| V-41022 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | It is critical that, when SQL Server is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. If the system were to continue processing without auditing enabled, actions could be taken on the system that could not be tracked and recorded for later forensic analysis. In many system configurations, the disk space allocated to the auditing system is separate from the disks allocated for the operating system; therefore, this may not result in a system outage. This places the onus on the DBMS to detect and take actions. A failure of SQL Server auditing will result in either the database continuing to function without auditing, or the halting of SQL Server operations. In this case, the database must cease processing immediately in order to not allow unlogged transaction to occur. Note that trace file rollover does not count as an audit failure, provided that the system is also configured to shut down when it runs out of space. Trace file rollover can be a useful technique for breaking the log into manageable pieces, for archiving, or for transfer to a log management system. |
| V-41024 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Configure SQL Server during the installation and/or configuration process to determine if adequate storage capacity has been allocated for audit logs. If SQL Server audit logs that are being generated exceed the amount of space reserved for those logs, the system may shutdown or take other measures to stop processing in order to protect transactions from continuing unlogged. After the initial setup of SQL Server audit log configuration, it is best to check the available space frequently until the maximum number of files has been reached. Checking the available space can help determine the balance of online audit data with space required. |
| V-41027 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | SQL Server auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server does have a means available to add organizationally defined additional, more detailed information in the audit event records. These events may be identified by type, location, or subject. An example of more detailed information the organization may require in audit records could be the name of the application where the request is coming from. Some organizations may determine that more detailed information is required for specific database event types. If this information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events. |
| V-41028 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Database software is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly who performed a given action. If user identification information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. |
| V-41029 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know the outcome of attempted actions. This requires specific information regarding the outcome of the action or event that the audit record is referring to. If outcome status information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. Success and failure indicators ascertain the outcome of a particular event. As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Without knowing the outcome of audit events, it is very difficult to accurately recreate the series of events during forensic analysis. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the outcome status-specific information in all audit records. |
| V-41030 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly who performed what actions. This requires specific information regarding the source of the event an audit record is referring to. If the source of the event information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. The source of the event can be a user account and sometimes a system account when timed jobs are run. Without information establishing the source of activity, the value of audit records from a forensics perspective is questionable. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the source of the event-specific information in all audit records. |
| V-41031 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly where actions were performed. This requires specific information regarding the event location an audit record is referring to. If event location information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. An event location can be a database instance, table, column, row, etc. Without sufficient information establishing where the audit events occurred, investigation into the cause of events is severely hindered. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the event location-specific information in all audit records. |
| V-41032 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly when actions were performed. This requires specific information regarding the date and time an audit record is referring to. If date and time information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the date and time-specific information in all audit records. |
| V-41033 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly what actions were performed. This requires specific information regarding the event type an audit record is referring to. If event type information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use. If auditing is enabled, SQL Server does capture the event type-specific information in all audit records. |
| V-41035 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system, such as network interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited, as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked). Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components shall provide auditable events. Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the SQL Server configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability. |
| V-41037 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | SQL Server's 'sa' account has special privileges required to administer the database. The 'sa' account is a well-known SQL Server account name and is likely to be targeted by attackers, and is thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. Since the SQL Server 'sa' is administrative in nature, the compromise of a default account can have catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. Since SQL Server needs for this account to exist and it should not be removed, one way to mitigate this risk is to change the 'sa' account name. |
| V-41042 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | This is intended to limit exposure, by making it possible to trace any unauthorized access to other data or functionality by a privileged user account or role that has permissions on security functions or security-relevant information. |
| V-41207 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | The concept of least privilege must be applied to SQL Server processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions and/or functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and SQL Server accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege concepts to the design, development, implementation, and operations of SQL Server and the OS. Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user. Privileges granted outside of SQL Server's role-based account assignments are more likely to go unmanaged and without oversight of granted access. Maintenance of privileges using roles defined for discrete job functions offers improved oversight of application user privilege assignments and helps to protect against unauthorized privilege assignment. SQL Server's 'Alter any endpoint' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. This administrative privilege must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts. If administrative user accounts have direct access to administrative privileges, this access must be removed. Note that this does not apply to logins with names of the form '##MS...##'. These accounts are internal-use system principals provisioned by the DBMS, and required by it for specific purposes. |
| V-41208 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | The concept of least privilege must be applied to SQL Server processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions and/or functions.

If the 'View any database' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed. Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role. The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE. Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission. If the user or role can inherent the permission from another role, revoking the denied permission from the user or the first role can effectively enable the inherited permission. |

SQL Server's 'Create server role' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. This administrative privilege must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts (or any other user accounts). If any user accounts have direct access to administrative privileges, this access must be removed. Note that this does not apply to logins with names of the form '##MS...##'.

| V-41305 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, they often attempt to create a persistent method of re-establishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to modify an existing account for later use. Notification of account creation is one method and best practice for mitigating this risk.

Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.

| V-41306 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, they often attempt to create a persistent method of re-establishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to simply modify an existing account. Auditing of account modification is one method and best practice for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive application account management process ensures an audit trail automatically documents the modification of application user accounts and, as required, notifies administrators, application owners, and/or appropriate individuals. Applications must provide this capability directly, leverage complimentary technology providing this capability, or a combination thereof.

| V-41307 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these internetworking mechanisms is private or secure, and they do not by default restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established. Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations post security incident.  |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-79197 | SecurityOptionRule | SecurityOption | The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates. PKI certificate-based authentication is performed by requiring the certificate holder to cryptographically prove possession of the corresponding private key. If the private key is stolen, an attacker can use the private key(s) to impersonate the certificate holder. In cases where SQL Server-stored private keys are used to authenticate SQL Server to the system’s clients, loss of the corresponding private keys would allow an attacker to successfully perform undetected man in the middle attacks against SQL Server system and its clients. Both the holder of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must take careful measures to protect the corresponding private key. Private keys should always be generated and protected in FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. All access to the private key(s) of SQL Server must be restricted to authorized and authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to one or more of SQL Server's private keys, an attacker could gain access to the key(s) and use them to impersonate the database on the network or otherwise perform unauthorized actions. |
| V-79141 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Session auditing is for use when a user's activities are under investigation. To be sure of capturing all activity during those periods when session auditing is in use, it needs to be in operation for the whole time SQL Server is running. |
| V-79239 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions against changes to configuration, it would be difficult to identify attempted attacks and an audit trail would not be available for forensic investigation for after-the-fact actions. Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact. |
| V-79259 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users. In an SQL environment, adding permissions is typically done via the GRANT command, or, in the negative, the DENY command. |
| V-79261 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected. In an SQL environment, adding permissions is typically done via the GRANT command, or, in the negative, the DENY command. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79263 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users. In an SQL environment, modifying permissions is typically done via the GRANT, REVOKE, and DENY commands. |
| V-79265 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected. In an SQL environment, modifying permissions is typically done via the GRANT, REVOKE, and DENY commands. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79267 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the database objects (tables, views, procedures, functions) that record and control permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized changes to the security subsystem could go undetected. The database could be severely compromised or rendered inoperative. |
| V-79269 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the database objects (tables, views, procedures, functions) that record and control permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized changes to the security subsystem could go undetected. The database could be severely compromised or rendered inoperative. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79275 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users. In an SQL environment, deleting permissions is typically done via the REVOKE or DENY command. |
| V-79277 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected. In an SQL environment, deleting permissions is typically done via the REVOKE or DENY command. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79279 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | The removal of security objects from the database/DBMS would seriously degrade a system's information assurance posture. If such an event occurs, it must be logged. |
| V-79281 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | The removal of security objects from the database/DBMS would seriously degrade a system's information assurance posture. If such an action is attempted, it must be logged. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79287 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track who/what (a user or other principal) logs on to SQL Server. |
| V-79289 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track failed attempts to log on to SQL Server. While positive identification may not be possible in a case of failed authentication, as much information as possible about the incident must be captured. |
| V-79291 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Without tracking privileged activity, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged. A privileged function in this context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: CREATE ALTER DROP GRANT REVOKE DENY There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples in SQL include: TRUNCATE TABLE; DELETE, or DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or DELETE without a WHERE clause; UPDATE or UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or UPDATE without a WHERE clause; any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal. Depending on the capabilities of SQL Server and the design of the database and associated applications, audit logging may be achieved by means of DBMS auditing features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these. Note that it is particularly important to audit, and tightly control, any action that weakens the implementation of this requirement itself, since the objective is to have a complete audit trail of all administrative activity. |
| V-79293 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Without tracking privileged activity, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79295 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to know how long a user's (or other principal's) connection to SQL Server lasts. This can be achieved by recording disconnections, in addition to logons/connections, in the audit logs. Disconnection may be initiated by the user or forced by the system (as in a timeout) or result from a system or network failure. To the greatest extent possible, all disconnections must be logged. |
| V-79297 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track who logs on to SQL Server. Concurrent connections by the same user from multiple workstations may be valid use of the system; or such connections may be due to improper circumvention of the requirement to use the CAC for authentication; or they may indicate unauthorized account sharing; or they may be because an account has been compromised. (If the fact of multiple, concurrent logons by a given user can be reliably reconstructed from the log entries for other events (logons/connections; voluntary and involuntary disconnections), then it is not mandatory to create additional log entries specifically for this.) |
| V-79317 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | SQL Server's [sa] account has special privileges required to administer the database. The [sa] account is a well-known SQL Server account and is likely to be targeted by attackers and thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. This [sa] default account is administrative and could lead to catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. If the [sa] default account is not disabled, an attacker might be able to gain access through the account. SQL Server by default, at installation, disables the [sa] account. Some applications that run on SQL Server require the [sa] account to be enabled in order for the application to function properly. These applications that require the [sa] account to be enabled are usually legacy systems. |
| V-79319 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | SQL Server's [sa] account has special privileges required to administer the database. The [sa] account is a well-known SQL Server account name and is likely to be targeted by attackers, and is thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. Since the SQL Server [sa] is administrative in nature, the compromise of a default account can have catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. Since SQL Server needs for this account to exist and it should not be removed, one way to mitigate this risk is to change the [sa] account name. |

| V-79197 | SecurityOptionRule | SecurityOption | The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates. PKI certificate-based authentication is performed by requiring the certificate holder to cryptographically prove possession of the corresponding private key. If the private key is stolen, an attacker can use the private key(s) to impersonate the certificate holder. In cases where SQL Server-stored private keys are used to authenticate SQL Server to the system’s clients, loss of the corresponding private keys would allow an attacker to successfully perform undetected man in the middle attacks against SQL Server system and its clients. Both the holder of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must take careful measures to protect the corresponding private key. Private keys should always be generated and protected in FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. All access to the private key(s) of SQL Server must be restricted to authorized and authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to one or more of SQL Server's private keys, an attacker could gain access to the key(s) and use them to impersonate the database on the network or otherwise perform unauthorized actions. |
| V-79141 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Session auditing is for use when a user's activities are under investigation. To be sure of capturing all activity during those periods when session auditing is in use, it needs to be in operation for the whole time SQL Server is running. |
| V-79239 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions against changes to configuration, it would be difficult to identify attempted attacks and an audit trail would not be available for forensic investigation for after-the-fact actions. Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact. |
| V-79259 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users. In an SQL environment, adding permissions is typically done via the GRANT command, or, in the negative, the DENY command. |
| V-79261 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected. In an SQL environment, adding permissions is typically done via the GRANT command, or, in the negative, the DENY command. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79263 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users. In an SQL environment, modifying permissions is typically done via the GRANT, REVOKE, and DENY commands. |
| V-79265 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected. In an SQL environment, modifying permissions is typically done via the GRANT, REVOKE, and DENY commands. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79267 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the database objects (tables, views, procedures, functions) that record and control permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized changes to the security subsystem could go undetected. The database could be severely compromised or rendered inoperative. |
| V-79269 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the database objects (tables, views, procedures, functions) that record and control permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized changes to the security subsystem could go undetected. The database could be severely compromised or rendered inoperative. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79275 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users. In an SQL environment, deleting permissions is typically done via the REVOKE or DENY command. |
| V-79277 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected. In an SQL environment, deleting permissions is typically done via the REVOKE or DENY command. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79279 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | The removal of security objects from the database/DBMS would seriously degrade a system's information assurance posture. If such an event occurs, it must be logged. |
| V-79281 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | The removal of security objects from the database/DBMS would seriously degrade a system's information assurance posture. If such an action is attempted, it must be logged. To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79287 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track who/what (a user or other principal) logs on to SQL Server. |
| V-79289 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track failed attempts to log on to SQL Server. While positive identification may not be possible in a case of failed authentication, as much information as possible about the incident must be captured. |
| V-79291 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Without tracking privileged activity, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged. A privileged function in this context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: CREATE ALTER DROP GRANT REVOKE DENY There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples in SQL include: TRUNCATE TABLE; DELETE, or DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or DELETE without a WHERE clause; UPDATE or UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or UPDATE without a WHERE clause; any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal. Depending on the capabilities of SQL Server and the design of the database and associated applications, audit logging may be achieved by means of DBMS auditing features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these. Note that it is particularly important to audit, and tightly control, any action that weakens the implementation of this requirement itself, since the objective is to have a complete audit trail of all administrative activity. |
| V-79293 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | Without tracking privileged activity, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones. |
| V-79295 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to know how long a user's (or other principal's) connection to SQL Server lasts. This can be achieved by recording disconnections, in addition to logons/connections, in the audit logs. Disconnection may be initiated by the user or forced by the system (as in a timeout) or result from a system or network failure. To the greatest extent possible, all disconnections must be logged. |
| V-79297 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track who logs on to SQL Server. Concurrent connections by the same user from multiple workstations may be valid use of the system; or such connections may be due to improper circumvention of the requirement to use the CAC for authentication; or they may indicate unauthorized account sharing; or they may be because an account has been compromised. (If the fact of multiple, concurrent logons by a given user can be reliably reconstructed from the log entries for other events (logons/connections; voluntary and involuntary disconnections), then it is not mandatory to create additional log entries specifically for this.) |
| V-79317 | SqlScriptQueryRule | SqlScriptQuery | SQL Server's [sa] account has special privileges required to administer the database. The [sa] account is a well-known SQL Server account and is likely to be targeted by attackers and thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. This [sa] default account is administrative and could lead to catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. If the [sa] default account is not disabled, an attacker might be able to gain access through the account. SQL Server by default, at installation, disables the [sa] account. Some applications that run on SQL Server require the [sa] account to be enabled in order for the application to function properly. These applications that require the [sa] account to be enabled are usually legacy systems. |
| V-79319 | SqlScriptQueryRule | None | SQL Server's [sa] account has special privileges required to administer the database. The [sa] account is a well-known SQL Server account name and is likely to be targeted by attackers, and is thus more prone to providing unauthorized access to the database. Since the SQL Server [sa] is administrative in nature, the compromise of a default account can have catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over SQL Server. Since SQL Server needs for this account to exist and it should not be removed, one way to mitigate this risk is to change the [sa] account name. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-63405 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the amount of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-63409 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user logon. |
| V-63413 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to 0. The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. |
| V-63415 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change a password to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is 24 for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-63419 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-63421 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-63423 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-63427 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against guessing and brute-force attacks. This setting configures the system to verify that newly created passwords conform to the Windows password complexity policy. |
| V-63429 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-63431 | AuditPolicyRule | AuditPolicySubcategory | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks.

"Basic" sends basic diagnostic and usage data and may be required to support some Microsoft services. "Enhanced" includes additional information on how Windows and apps are used and advanced reliability data. Windows Analytics can use a "limited enhanced" level to provide information such as health data for devices. This requires the configuration of an additional setting available with v1709 and later of Windows 10.  |
| V-63687 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default Windows configuration caches the last logon credentials for users who log on interactively to a system. This feature is provided for system availability reasons, such as the user's machine being disconnected from the network or domain controllers being unavailable. Even though the credential cache is well-protected, if a system is attacked, an unauthorized individual may isolate the password to a domain user account using a password-cracking program and gain access to the domain. |
| V-63689 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ata Execution Prevention (DEP) provides additional protection by performing checks on memory to help prevent malicious code from running. This setting will prevent Data Execution Prevention from being turned off for File Explorer. |

| V-63737 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing unsecure RPC communication exposes the system to man in the middle attacks and data disclosure attacks. A man in the middle attack occurs when an intruder captures packets between a client and server and modifies them before allowing the packets to be exchanged. Usually the attacker will modify the information in the packets in an attempt to cause either the client or server to reveal sensitive information. |
| V-63741 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote connections must be encrypted to prevent interception of data or sensitive information. Selecting "High Level" will ensure encryption of Remote Desktop Services sessions in both directions. |
| V-63743 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Attachments from RSS feeds may not be secure. This setting will prevent attachments from being downloaded from RSS feeds. |
| V-63745 | RegistryRule | Registry | Anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts allows anonymous log on users (null session connections) to list all accounts names, thus providing a list of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-63747 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Basic authentication uses plain text passwords that could be used to compromise a system. |
| V-63749 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-63751 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Indexing of encrypted files may expose sensitive data. This setting prevents encrypted files from being indexed. |
| V-63755 | RegistryRule | Registry | Access by anonymous users must be restricted. If this setting is enabled, then anonymous users have the same rights and permissions as the built-in Everyone group. Anonymous users must not have these permissions or rights. |
| V-63759 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |
| V-63763 | RegistryRule | Registry | Services using Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM authentication may gain unauthorized access if allowed to authenticate anonymously vs. using the computer identity. |
| V-63765 | RegistryRule | Registry | NTLM sessions that are allowed to fall back to Null (unauthenticated) sessions may gain unauthorized access. |
| V-63767 | RegistryRule | Registry | PKU2U is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol. This setting prevents online identities from authenticating to domain-joined systems. Authentication will be centrally managed with Windows user accounts. |
| V-63795 | RegistryRule | Registry | Certain encryption types are no longer considered secure. This setting configures a minimum encryption type for Kerberos, preventing the use of the DES and RC4 encryption suites. |
| V-63797 | RegistryRule | Registry | The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether or not a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-63801 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to stand-alone computers that are running later versions. |
| V-63803 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the signing requirements for LDAP clients. This setting must be set to Negotiate signing or Require signing, depending on the environment and type of LDAP server in use. |
| V-63805 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-63807 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-63811 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting ensures that the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing. FIPS-compliant algorithms meet specific standards established by the U.S. Government and must be the algorithms used for all OS encryption functions. |
| V-63815 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions. If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing non-admin users to read shared objects, but not modify shared objects that they did not create. |
| V-63817 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the built-in Administrator account so that it runs in Admin Approval Mode. |
| V-63819 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the elevation requirements for logged on administrators to complete a task that requires raised privileges. |
| V-63821 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. Denying elevation requests from standard user accounts requires tasks that need elevation to be initiated by accounts with administrative privileges. This ensures correct accounts are used on the system for privileged tasks to help mitigate credential theft. |
| V-63825 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting requires Windows to respond to application installation requests by prompting for credentials. |
| V-63827 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures Windows to only allow applications installed in a secure location on the file system, such as the Program Files or the Windows\System32 folders, to run with elevated privileges. |
| V-63829 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting enables UAC. |
| V-63831 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures non-UAC compliant applications to run in virtualized file and registry entries in per-user locations, allowing them to run. |
| V-63839 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Toast notifications that are displayed on the lock screen could display sensitive information to unauthorized personnel. Turning off this feature will limit access to the information to a logged on user. |
| V-63841 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Preserving zone of origin (internet, intranet, local, restricted) information on file attachments allows Windows to determine risk. |
| V-65681.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Windows 10 allows Windows Update to obtain updates from additional sources instead of Microsoft. In addition to Microsoft, updates can be obtained from and sent to PCs on the local network as well as on the Internet. This is part of the Windows Update trusted process, however to minimize outside exposure, obtaining updates from or sending to systems on the Internet must be prevented. |
| V-65681.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Windows 10 allows Windows Update to obtain updates from additional sources instead of Microsoft. In addition to Microsoft, updates can be obtained from and sent to PCs on the local network as well as on the Internet. This is part of the Windows Update trusted process, however to minimize outside exposure, obtaining updates from or sending to systems on the Internet must be prevented. |
| V-68817 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. Enabling "Include command line data for process creation events" will record the command line information with the process creation events in the log. This can provide additional detail when malware has run on a system. |
| V-68819 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. Enabling PowerShell script block logging will record detailed information from the processing of PowerShell commands and scripts. This can provide additional detail when malware has run on a system. |
| V-68849 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Attackers are constantly looking for vulnerabilities in systems and applications. Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) blocks exploits that use the Structured Exception Handling overwrite technique, a common buffer overflow attack. |
| V-71763 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | When the WDigest Authentication protocol is enabled, plain text passwords are stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) exposing them to theft. WDigest is disabled by default in Windows 10. This setting ensures this is enforced. |
| V-71765 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Internet connection sharing makes it possible for an existing internet connection, such as through wireless, to be shared and used by other systems essentially creating a mobile hotspot. This exposes the system sharing the connection to others with potentially malicious purpose. |
| V-71769 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Windows Security Account Manager (SAM) stores users' passwords. Restricting remote rpc connections to the SAM to Administrators helps protect those credentials. |
| V-71771 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Microsoft consumer experiences provides suggestions and notifications to users, which may include the installation of Windows Store apps. Organizations may control the execution of applications through other means such as whitelisting. Turning off Microsoft consumer experiences will help prevent the unwanted installation of suggested applications. |
| V-72329.a | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Run as different user" selection from context menus allows the use of credentials other than the currently logged on user. Using privileged credentials in a standard user session can expose those credentials to theft. Removing this option from context menus helps prevent this from occurring. |
| V-72329.b | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Run as different user" selection from context menus allows the use of credentials other than the currently logged on user. Using privileged credentials in a standard user session can expose those credentials to theft. Removing this option from context menus helps prevent this from occurring. |
| V-72329.c | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Run as different user" selection from context menus allows the use of credentials other than the currently logged on user. Using privileged credentials in a standard user session can expose those credentials to theft. Removing this option from context menus helps prevent this from occurring. |
| V-72329.d | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The "Run as different user" selection from context menus allows the use of credentials other than the currently logged on user. Using privileged credentials in a standard user session can expose those credentials to theft. Removing this option from context menus helps prevent this from occurring. |
| V-74413 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. By default Windows uses ECC curves with shorter key lengths first. Requiring ECC curves with longer key lengths to be prioritized first helps ensure more secure algorithms are used. |
| V-74415 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Clearing browser data on exit automatically deletes specified items when the last browser window closes. This data could be used to identify malicious websites and files that could later be used for anti-virus and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) signatures. Disabling this function will prevent the data from automatically being deleted when the browser closes. |
| V-74417 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Windows Game Recording and Broadcasting is intended for use with games, however it could potentially record screen shots of other applications and expose sensitive data. Disabling the feature will prevent this from occurring. |
| V-74699 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | An exportable version of credentials is provided to remote hosts when using credential delegation which exposes them to theft on the remote host. Restricted Admin mode or Remote Credential Guard allow delegation of non-exportable credentials providing additional protection of the credentials. Enabling this configures the host to support Restricted Admin mode or Remote Credential Guard. |
| V-74723 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | SMBv1 is a legacy protocol that uses the MD5 algorithm as part of SMB. MD5 is known to be vulnerable to a number of attacks such as collision and preimage attacks as well as not being FIPS compliant. Disabling SMBv1 support may prevent access to file or print sharing resources with systems or devices that only support SMBv1. File shares and print services hosted on Windows Server 2003 are an example, however Windows Server 2003 is no longer a supported operating system. Some older network attached devices may only support SMBv1. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-63405 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the amount of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-63409 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user logon. |
| V-63413 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to 0. The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. |
| V-63415 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change a password to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is 24 for Windows domain systems.

| V-63737 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing unsecure RPC communication exposes the system to man in the middle attacks and data disclosure attacks. A man in the middle attack occurs when an intruder captures packets between a client and server and modifies them before allowing the packets to be exchanged. Usually the attacker will modify the information in the packets in an attempt to cause either the client or server to reveal sensitive information. |
| V-63741 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote connections must be encrypted to prevent interception of data or sensitive information. Selecting "High Level" will ensure encryption of Remote Desktop Services sessions in both directions. |
| V-63743 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Attachments from RSS feeds may not be secure. This setting will prevent attachments from being downloaded from RSS feeds. |
| V-63745 | RegistryRule | Registry | Anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts allows anonymous log on users (null session connections) to list all accounts names, thus providing a list of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-63747 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Basic authentication uses plain text passwords that could be used to compromise a system. |
| V-63749 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-63751 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Indexing of encrypted files may expose sensitive data. This setting prevents encrypted files from being indexed. |
| V-63755 | RegistryRule | Registry | Access by anonymous users must be restricted. If this setting is enabled, then anonymous users have the same rights and permissions as the built-in Everyone group. Anonymous users must not have these permissions or rights. |
| V-63759 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |

| V-63765 | RegistryRule | Registry | NTLM sessions that are allowed to fall back to Null (unauthenticated) sessions may gain unauthorized access. |
| V-63767 | RegistryRule | Registry | PKU2U is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol. This setting prevents online identities from authenticating to domain-joined systems. Authentication will be centrally managed with Windows user accounts. |
| V-63795 | RegistryRule | Registry | Certain encryption types are no longer considered secure. This setting configures a minimum encryption type for Kerberos, preventing the use of the DES and RC4 encryption suites. |
| V-63797 | RegistryRule | Registry | The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether or not a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-63801 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to stand-alone computers that are running later versions. |
| V-63803 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the signing requirements for LDAP clients. This setting must be set to Negotiate signing or Require signing, depending on the environment and type of LDAP server in use. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-75147 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | After enabling this feature, Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) protection blocking takes effect on endpoint clients after the next signature update or computer restart. Signature updates take place daily under typical circumstances. PUA will be blocked and automatically quarantined. |
| V-75151 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure whether Windows Defender automatically takes action on all detected threats. The action to be taken on a particular threat is determined by the combination of the policy-defined action user-defined action and the signature-defined action. If you enable this policy setting Windows Defender does not automatically take action on the detected threats but prompts users to choose from the actions available for each threat. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting Windows Defender automatically takes action on all detected threats after a nonconfigurable delay of approximately five seconds. |
| V-75153 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting turns off Windows Defender Antivirus. If you enable this policy setting Windows Defender Antivirus does not run and computers are not scanned for malware or other potentially unwanted software. When the setting is Disabled and a third-party antivirus solution is installed, the two applications can both simultaneously try to protect the system. The two AV solutions both attempt to quarantine the same threat and will fight for access to delete the file. Users will see conflicts and the system may lock up until the two solutions finish processing. When the setting is Not Configured and a third-party antivirus solution is installed, both applications co-exist on the system without conflicts. Defender Antivirus will automatically disable itself and will enable if the third-party solution stops functioning. When the setting is Not Configured and Defender Antivirus is the only AV solution, Defender AV will run (default state) and receive definition updates. An administrator account is needed to turn off the service. A standard user cannot disable the service.  |
| V-75155 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to disable scheduled and real-time scanning for files under the paths specified or for the fully qualified resources specified. Paths should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair where the name should be a string representation of a path or a fully qualified resource name. As an example a path might be defined as: "c:\Windows" to exclude all files in this directory. A fully qualified resource name might be defined as: "C:\Windows\App.exe". The value is not used and it is recommended that this be set to 0. |
| V-75157 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to disable scheduled and real-time scanning for any file opened by any of the specified processes. The process itself will not be excluded. To exclude the process use the Path exclusion. Processes should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair where the name should be a string representation of the path to the process image. Note that only executables can be excluded. For example a process might be defined as: "c:\windows\app.exe". The value is not used and it is recommended that this be set to 0. |
| V-75159 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allows an administrator to specify if Automatic Exclusions feature for Server SKUs should be turned off. |
| V-75161 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration to join Microsoft MAPS. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75163 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This feature ensures the device checks in real time with the Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) before allowing certain content to be run or accessed. If this feature is disabled the check will not occur which will lower the protection state of the device. Enabled - The Block at First Sight setting is turned on. Disabled - The Block at First Sight setting is turned off. This feature requires these Group Policy settings to be set as follows: MAPS -> The "Join Microsoft MAPS" must be enabled or the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. MAPS -> The "Send file samples when further analysis is required" should be set to 1 (Send safe samples) or 3 (Send all samples). Setting to 0 (Always Prompt) will lower the protection state of the device. Setting to 2 (Never send) means the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. Real-time Protection -> The "Scan all downloaded files and attachments" policy must be enabled or the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. Real-time Protection -> Do not enable the "Turn off real-time protection" policy or the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. |
| V-75167 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft MAPS. Microsoft MAPS is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer. This information can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information will be automatically collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However Microsoft will not use this information to identify you or contact you. Possible options are: (0x0) Disabled (default) (0x1) Basic membership (0x2) Advanced membership Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful. Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer. If you enable this setting you will join Microsoft MAPS with the membership specified. If you disable or do not configure this setting you will not join Microsoft MAPS. In Windows 10 Basic membership is no longer available so setting the value to 1 or 2 enrolls the device into Advanced membership. Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Turning off this feature will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system. This setting disables Microsoft Active Protection Service membership and reporting. |
| V-75207 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures behavior of samples submission when opt-in for MAPS telemetry is set. Possible options are: (0x0) Always prompt (0x1) Send safe samples automatically (0x2) Never send (0x3) Send all samples automatically. |
| V-75209 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure protocol recognition for network protection against exploits of known vulnerabilities. If you enable or do not configure this setting protocol recognition will be enabled. If you disable this setting protocol recognition will be disabled. |
| V-75211 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of monitoring for file and program activity on your computer. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75213 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of monitoring for incoming and outgoing file activity. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75215 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of scanning for all downloaded files and attachments. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75217 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of behavior monitoring. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75219 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration to turn on real-time protection. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75221 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure monitoring for incoming and outgoing files without having to turn off monitoring entirely. It is recommended for use on servers where there is a lot of incoming and outgoing file activity but for performance reasons need to have scanning disabled for a particular scan direction. The appropriate configuration should be evaluated based on the server role. Note that this configuration is only honored for NTFS volumes. For any other file system type full monitoring of file and program activity will be present on those volumes. The options for this setting are mutually exclusive: 0 = Scan incoming and outgoing files (default) 1 = Scan incoming files only 2 = Scan outgoing files only Any other value or if the value does not exist resolves to the default (0). If you enable this setting the specified type of monitoring will be enabled. If you disable or do not configure this setting monitoring for incoming and outgoing files will be enabled. |
| V-75223 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure monitoring for file and program activity. If you enable or do not configure this setting monitoring for file and program activity will be enabled. If you disable this setting monitoring for file and program activity will be disabled. |
| V-75225 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure scanning for all downloaded files and attachments.

This helps to catch malware which could start when real-time protection is turned off. If you enable or do not configure this setting a process scan will be initiated when real-time protection is turned on. If you disable this setting a process scan will not be initiated when real-time protection is turned on. |
| V-75233 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure scans for malicious software and unwanted software in archive files such as .ZIP or .CAB files. If you enable or do not configure this setting archive files will be scanned. If you disable this setting archive files will not be scanned. |
| V-75235 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether or not to scan for malicious software and unwanted software in the contents of removable drives such as USB flash drives when running a full scan. If you enable this setting removable drives will be scanned during any type of scan. If you disable or do not configure this setting removable drives will not be scanned during a full scan. Removable drives may still be scanned during quick scan and custom scan. |
| V-75237 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to specify the day of the week on which to perform a scheduled scan. The scan can also be configured to run every day or to never run at all. This setting can be configured with the following ordinal number values: (0x0) Every Day (0x1) Sunday (0x2) Monday (0x3) Tuesday (0x4) Wednesday (0x5) Thursday (0x6) Friday (0x7) Saturday (0x8) Never (default) If you enable this setting a scheduled scan will run at the frequency specified. If you disable or do not configure this setting a scheduled scan will run at a default frequency. |
| V-75239 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure e-mail scanning. When e-mail scanning is enabled the engine will parse the mailbox and mail files according to their specific format in order to analyze the mail bodies and attachments. Several e-mail formats are currently supported for example: pst (Outlook) dbx mbx mime (Outlook Express) binhex (Mac). If you enable this setting e-mail scanning will be enabled. If you disable or do not configure this setting e-mail scanning will be disabled. |
| V-75241 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to define the number of days that must pass before spyware definitions are considered out of date. If definitions are determined to be out of date this state may trigger several additional actions including falling back to an alternative update source or displaying a warning icon in the user interface. By default this value is set to 14 days. If you enable this setting spyware definitions will be considered out of date after the number of days specified have passed without an update. If you disable or do not configure this setting spyware definitions will be considered out of date after the default number of days have passed without an update. |
| V-75243 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to define the number of days that must pass before virus definitions are considered out of date. If definitions are determined to be out of date this state may trigger several additional actions including falling back to an alternative update source or displaying a warning icon in the user interface. By default this value is set to 14 days. If you enable this setting virus definitions will be considered out of date after the number of days specified have passed without an update. If you disable or do not configure this setting virus definitions will be considered out of date after the default number of days have passed without an update. |
| V-75245 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to specify the day of the week on which to check for definition updates. The check can also be configured to run every day or to never run at all.

If you disable or do not configure this setting the check for definition updates will occur at a default frequency. |
| V-75247 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to customize which automatic remediation action will be taken for each threat alert level. Threat alert levels should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair. The name defines a threat alert level. The value contains the action ID for the remediation action that should be taken. Valid threat alert levels are: 1 = Low 2 = Medium 4 = High 5 = Severe Valid remediation action values are: 2 = Quarantine 3 = Remove 6 = Ignore |
| V-77965 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This rule blocks the following file types from being run or launched from an email seen in either Microsoft Outlook or webmail (such as Gmail.com or Outlook.com): Executable files (such as .exe, .dll, or .scr) Script files (such as a PowerShell .ps, VisualBasic .vbs, or JavaScript .js file) Script archive files |
| V-77967 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office apps, such as Word or Excel, will not be allowed to create child processes. This is a typical malware behavior, especially for macro-based attacks that attempt to use Office apps to launch or download malicious executables.  |
| V-77969 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This rule targets typical behaviors used by suspicious and malicious add-ons and scripts (extensions) that create or launch executable files. This is a typical malware technique. Extensions will be blocked from being used by Office apps. Typically these extensions use the Windows Scripting Host (.wsh files) to run scripts that automate certain tasks or provide user-created add-on features. |
| V-77971 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office apps, such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, will not be able to inject code into other processes. This is typically used by malware to run malicious code in an attempt to hide the activity from antivirus scanning engines. |
| V-77973 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | JavaScript and VBScript scripts can be used by malware to launch other malicious apps. This rule prevents these scripts from being allowed to launch apps, thus preventing malicious use of the scripts to spread malware and infect machines. |
| V-77975 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malware and other threats can attempt to obfuscate or hide their malicious code in some script files. This rule prevents scripts that appear to be obfuscated from running.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-75147 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | After enabling this feature, Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) protection blocking takes effect on endpoint clients after the next signature update or computer restart. Signature updates take place daily under typical circumstances. PUA will be blocked and automatically quarantined. |
| V-75151 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure whether Windows Defender automatically takes action on all detected threats. The action to be taken on a particular threat is determined by the combination of the policy-defined action user-defined action and the signature-defined action. If you enable this policy setting Windows Defender does not automatically take action on the detected threats but prompts users to choose from the actions available for each threat. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting Windows Defender automatically takes action on all detected threats after a nonconfigurable delay of approximately five seconds. |
| V-75153 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting turns off Windows Defender Antivirus. If you enable this policy setting Windows Defender Antivirus does not run and computers are not scanned for malware or other potentially unwanted software. When the setting is Disabled and a third-party antivirus solution is installed, the two applications can both simultaneously try to protect the system. The two AV solutions both attempt to quarantine the same threat and will fight for access to delete the file. Users will see conflicts and the system may lock up until the two solutions finish processing. When the setting is Not Configured and a third-party antivirus solution is installed, both applications co-exist on the system without conflicts. Defender Antivirus will automatically disable itself and will enable if the third-party solution stops functioning. When the setting is Not Configured and Defender Antivirus is the only AV solution, Defender AV will run (default state) and receive definition updates. An administrator account is needed to turn off the service. A standard user cannot disable the service.  |
| V-75155 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to disable scheduled and real-time scanning for files under the paths specified or for the fully qualified resources specified. Paths should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair where the name should be a string representation of a path or a fully qualified resource name. As an example a path might be defined as: "c:\Windows" to exclude all files in this directory. A fully qualified resource name might be defined as: "C:\Windows\App.exe". The value is not used and it is recommended that this be set to 0. |
| V-75157 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to disable scheduled and real-time scanning for any file opened by any of the specified processes. The process itself will not be excluded. To exclude the process use the Path exclusion. Processes should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair where the name should be a string representation of the path to the process image. Note that only executables can be excluded. For example a process might be defined as: "c:\windows\app.exe". The value is not used and it is recommended that this be set to 0. |
| V-75159 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allows an administrator to specify if Automatic Exclusions feature for Server SKUs should be turned off. |
| V-75161 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration to join Microsoft MAPS. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75163 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This feature ensures the device checks in real time with the Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) before allowing certain content to be run or accessed. If this feature is disabled the check will not occur which will lower the protection state of the device. Enabled - The Block at First Sight setting is turned on. Disabled - The Block at First Sight setting is turned off. This feature requires these Group Policy settings to be set as follows: MAPS -> The "Join Microsoft MAPS" must be enabled or the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. MAPS -> The "Send file samples when further analysis is required" should be set to 1 (Send safe samples) or 3 (Send all samples). Setting to 0 (Always Prompt) will lower the protection state of the device. Setting to 2 (Never send) means the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. Real-time Protection -> The "Scan all downloaded files and attachments" policy must be enabled or the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. Real-time Protection -> Do not enable the "Turn off real-time protection" policy or the "Block at First Sight" feature will not function. |
| V-75167 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft MAPS. Microsoft MAPS is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer. This information can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information will be automatically collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However Microsoft will not use this information to identify you or contact you. Possible options are: (0x0) Disabled (default) (0x1) Basic membership (0x2) Advanced membership Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful. Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer. If you enable this setting you will join Microsoft MAPS with the membership specified. If you disable or do not configure this setting you will not join Microsoft MAPS. In Windows 10 Basic membership is no longer available so setting the value to 1 or 2 enrolls the device into Advanced membership. Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Turning off this feature will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system. This setting disables Microsoft Active Protection Service membership and reporting. |
| V-75207 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures behavior of samples submission when opt-in for MAPS telemetry is set. Possible options are: (0x0) Always prompt (0x1) Send safe samples automatically (0x2) Never send (0x3) Send all samples automatically. |
| V-75209 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure protocol recognition for network protection against exploits of known vulnerabilities. If you enable or do not configure this setting protocol recognition will be enabled. If you disable this setting protocol recognition will be disabled. |
| V-75211 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of monitoring for file and program activity on your computer. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75213 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of monitoring for incoming and outgoing file activity. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75215 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of scanning for all downloaded files and attachments. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75217 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration of behavior monitoring. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75219 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration to turn on real-time protection. This setting can only be set by Group Policy. If you enable this setting the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy. If you disable or do not configure this setting Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting. |
| V-75221 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure monitoring for incoming and outgoing files without having to turn off monitoring entirely. It is recommended for use on servers where there is a lot of incoming and outgoing file activity but for performance reasons need to have scanning disabled for a particular scan direction. The appropriate configuration should be evaluated based on the server role. Note that this configuration is only honored for NTFS volumes. For any other file system type full monitoring of file and program activity will be present on those volumes. The options for this setting are mutually exclusive: 0 = Scan incoming and outgoing files (default) 1 = Scan incoming files only 2 = Scan outgoing files only Any other value or if the value does not exist resolves to the default (0). If you enable this setting the specified type of monitoring will be enabled. If you disable or do not configure this setting monitoring for incoming and outgoing files will be enabled. |
| V-75223 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure monitoring for file and program activity. If you enable or do not configure this setting monitoring for file and program activity will be enabled. If you disable this setting monitoring for file and program activity will be disabled. |
| V-75225 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure scanning for all downloaded files and attachments. If you enable or do not configure this setting scanning for all downloaded files and attachments will be enabled. If you disable this setting scanning for all downloaded files and attachments will be disabled. |
| V-75227 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting turns off real-time protection prompts for known malware detection. Windows Defender Antivirus alerts you when malware or potentially unwanted software attempts to install itself or to run on your computer. If you enable this policy setting Windows Defender Antivirus will not prompt users to take actions on malware detections. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting Windows Defender Antivirus will prompt users to take actions on malware detections. |
| V-75229 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure behavior monitoring. If you enable or do not configure this setting behavior monitoring will be enabled. If you disable this setting behavior monitoring will be disabled. |
| V-75231 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure process scanning when real-time protection is turned on. This helps to catch malware which could start when real-time protection is turned off. If you enable or do not configure this setting a process scan will be initiated when real-time protection is turned on. If you disable this setting a process scan will not be initiated when real-time protection is turned on. |
| V-75233 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure scans for malicious software and unwanted software in archive files such as .ZIP or .CAB files. If you enable or do not configure this setting archive files will be scanned. If you disable this setting archive files will not be scanned. |
| V-75235 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to manage whether or not to scan for malicious software and unwanted software in the contents of removable drives such as USB flash drives when running a full scan. If you enable this setting removable drives will be scanned during any type of scan. If you disable or do not configure this setting removable drives will not be scanned during a full scan. Removable drives may still be scanned during quick scan and custom scan. |
| V-75237 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to specify the day of the week on which to perform a scheduled scan. The scan can also be configured to run every day or to never run at all. This setting can be configured with the following ordinal number values: (0x0) Every Day (0x1) Sunday (0x2) Monday (0x3) Tuesday (0x4) Wednesday (0x5) Thursday (0x6) Friday (0x7) Saturday (0x8) Never (default) If you enable this setting a scheduled scan will run at the frequency specified. If you disable or do not configure this setting a scheduled scan will run at a default frequency. |
| V-75239 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to configure e-mail scanning. When e-mail scanning is enabled the engine will parse the mailbox and mail files according to their specific format in order to analyze the mail bodies and attachments. Several e-mail formats are currently supported for example: pst (Outlook) dbx mbx mime (Outlook Express) binhex (Mac). If you enable this setting e-mail scanning will be enabled. If you disable or do not configure this setting e-mail scanning will be disabled. |
| V-75241 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to define the number of days that must pass before spyware definitions are considered out of date. If definitions are determined to be out of date this state may trigger several additional actions including falling back to an alternative update source or displaying a warning icon in the user interface. By default this value is set to 14 days. If you enable this setting spyware definitions will be considered out of date after the number of days specified have passed without an update. If you disable or do not configure this setting spyware definitions will be considered out of date after the default number of days have passed without an update. |
| V-75243 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to define the number of days that must pass before virus definitions are considered out of date. If definitions are determined to be out of date this state may trigger several additional actions including falling back to an alternative update source or displaying a warning icon in the user interface. By default this value is set to 14 days. If you enable this setting virus definitions will be considered out of date after the number of days specified have passed without an update. If you disable or do not configure this setting virus definitions will be considered out of date after the default number of days have passed without an update. |
| V-75245 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to specify the day of the week on which to check for definition updates. The check can also be configured to run every day or to never run at all. This setting can be configured with the following ordinal number values: (0x0) Every Day (default) (0x1) Sunday (0x2) Monday (0x3) Tuesday (0x4) Wednesday (0x5) Thursday (0x6) Friday (0x7) Saturday (0x8) Never If you enable this setting the check for definition updates will occur at the frequency specified. If you disable or do not configure this setting the check for definition updates will occur at a default frequency. |
| V-75247 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to customize which automatic remediation action will be taken for each threat alert level. Threat alert levels should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair. The name defines a threat alert level. The value contains the action ID for the remediation action that should be taken. Valid threat alert levels are: 1 = Low 2 = Medium 4 = High 5 = Severe Valid remediation action values are: 2 = Quarantine 3 = Remove 6 = Ignore |
| V-77965 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This rule blocks the following file types from being run or launched from an email seen in either Microsoft Outlook or webmail (such as Gmail.com or Outlook.com): Executable files (such as .exe, .dll, or .scr) Script files (such as a PowerShell .ps, VisualBasic .vbs, or JavaScript .js file) Script archive files |
| V-77967 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office apps, such as Word or Excel, will not be allowed to create child processes. This is a typical malware behavior, especially for macro-based attacks that attempt to use Office apps to launch or download malicious executables.  |
| V-77969 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This rule targets typical behaviors used by suspicious and malicious add-ons and scripts (extensions) that create or launch executable files. This is a typical malware technique. Extensions will be blocked from being used by Office apps. Typically these extensions use the Windows Scripting Host (.wsh files) to run scripts that automate certain tasks or provide user-created add-on features. |
| V-77971 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Office apps, such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, will not be able to inject code into other processes. This is typically used by malware to run malicious code in an attempt to hide the activity from antivirus scanning engines. |
| V-77973 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | JavaScript and VBScript scripts can be used by malware to launch other malicious apps. This rule prevents these scripts from being allowed to launch apps, thus preventing malicious use of the scripts to spread malware and infect machines. |
| V-77975 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Malware and other threats can attempt to obfuscate or hide their malicious code in some script files. This rule prevents scripts that appear to be obfuscated from running. It uses the AntiMalwareScanInterface (AMSI) to determine if a script is potentially obfuscated, and then blocks such a script, or blocks scripts when an attempt is made to access them.  |
| V-77977 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This rule blocks potentially malicious behavior by not allowing macro code to execute routines in the Win 32 dynamic link library (DLL).  |
| V-77979 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enable Windows Defender Exploit Guard network protection to prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams exploit-hosting sites and other malicious content on the Internet. |
| V-79965 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This policy setting allows you to customize which automatic remediation action will be taken for each threat alert level. Threat alert levels should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair. The name defines a threat alert level.

**Description:** The Microsoft Windows 2012 Server Domain Name System Security Technical Implementation Guide is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. The requirements are derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 and related documents. Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via e-mail to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-58615 | DnsServerRootHintRule | Script | All caching name servers must be authoritative for the root zone because, without this starting point, they would have no knowledge of the DNS infrastructure and thus would be unable to respond to any queries. The security risk is that an adversary could change the root hints and direct the caching name server to a bogus root server. At that point, every query response from that name server is suspect, which would give the adversary substantial control over the network communication of the name servers' clients. When authoritative servers are sent queries for zones that they are not authoritative for, and they are configured as a non-caching server (as recommended), they can either be configured to return a referral to the root servers or they can be configured to refuse to answer the query. The recommendation is to configure authoritative servers to refuse to answer queries for any zones for which they are not authoritative. This is more efficient for the server and allows it to spend more of its resources doing what its intended purpose is, answering authoritatively for its zone. |
| V-58543 | DnsServerSettingRule | xDnsServerSetting | Without a means for identifying the individual that produced the information, the information cannot be relied upon. Identifying the validity of information may be delayed or deterred. This requirement ensures organizational personnel have a means to identify who produced or changed specific information in transfers, zone information, or DNS configuration changes. |
| V-58549 | DnsServerSettingRule | None | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. |
| V-58579 | DnsServerSettingRule | xDnsServerSetting | A potential vulnerability of DNS is that an attacker can poison a name server's cache by sending queries that will cause the server to obtain host-to-IP address mappings from bogus name servers that respond with incorrect information. Once a name server has been poisoned, legitimate clients may be directed to non-existent hosts (which constitutes a denial of service), or, worse, hosts that masquerade as legitimate ones to obtain sensitive data or passwords. To guard against poisoning, name servers authoritative for .mil domains should be separated functionally from name servers that resolve queries on behalf of internal clients. Organizations may achieve this separation by dedicating machines to each function or, if possible, by running two instances of the name server software on the same machine: one for the authoritative function and the other for the resolving function. In this design, each name server process may be bound to a different IP address or network interface to implement the required segregation. |
| V-58581 | DnsServerSettingRule | None | A potential vulnerability of DNS is that an attacker can poison a name server's cache by sending queries that will cause the server to obtain host-to-IP address mappings from bogus name servers that respond with incorrect information.

| V-58553.a | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. Since the configuration of the audit logs on the DNS server dictates which events are logged for the purposes of correlating events, the permissions for configuring the audit logs must be restricted to only those with the role of ISSM or those appointed by the ISSM. |
| V-58641 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information. If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user. Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys. SIG(0) is used for server-to-server authentication for DNS transactions, and it uses PKI-based authentication. So, in cases where SIG(0) is being used instead of TSIG (which uses a shared key, not PKI-based authentication), this requirement is applicable. |
| V-58643 | PermissionRule | None | To enable zone transfer (requests and responses) through authenticated messages, it is necessary to generate a key for every pair of name servers. The key can also be used for securing other transactions, such as dynamic updates, DNS queries, and responses. The binary key string that is generated by most key generation utilities used with DNSSEC is Base64-encoded. TSIG is a string used to generate the message authentication hash stored in a TSIG RR and used to authenticate an entire DNS message. |
| V-58645 | PermissionRule | None | To enable zone transfer (requests and responses) through authenticated messages, it is necessary to generate a key for every pair of name servers. The key can also be used for securing other transactions, such as dynamic updates, DNS queries, and responses. The binary key string that is generated by most key generation utilities used with DNSSEC is Base64-encoded. TSIG is a string used to generate the message authentication hash stored in a TSIG RR and used to authenticate an entire DNS message. |
| V-58553.b | UserRightRule | UserRightsAssignment | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. Since the configuration of the audit logs on the DNS server dictates which events are logged for the purposes of correlating events, the permissions for configuring the audit logs must be restricted to only those with the role of ISSM or those appointed by the ISSM. |
| V-58697.a | UserRightRule | UserRightsAssignment | Applications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use an authorized application to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. For example, applications may include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks. |
| V-58697.b | UserRightRule | UserRightsAssignment | Applications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use an authorized application to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. For example, applications may include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks. |

For example, applications may include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks. |
| V-58555 | WinEventLogRule | xWinEventLog | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. In order to compile an accurate risk assessment, it is essential for security personnel to know what is being performed on the system, where an event occurred, when an event occurred, and by whom the event was triggered. Logging the actions of specific events provides a means to investigate an attack, recognize resource utilization or capacity thresholds, or to simply identify an improperly configured DNS system. If auditing is not comprehensive, it will not be useful for intrusion monitoring, security investigations, and forensic analysis. It is important, therefore, to log all possible data related to events so that they can be correlated and analyzed to determine the risk. Data required to be captured include: whether an event was successful or failed, the event type or category, timestamps for when the event occurred, where the event originated, who/what initiated the event, affect the event had on the DNS implementation and any processes associated with the event. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-58615 | DnsServerRootHintRule | Script | All caching name servers must be authoritative for the root zone because, without this starting point, they would have no knowledge of the DNS infrastructure and thus would be unable to respond to any queries. The security risk is that an adversary could change the root hints and direct the caching name server to a bogus root server. At that point, every query response from that name server is suspect, which would give the adversary substantial control over the network communication of the name servers' clients. When authoritative servers are sent queries for zones that they are not authoritative for, and they are configured as a non-caching server (as recommended), they can either be configured to return a referral to the root servers or they can be configured to refuse to answer the query. The recommendation is to configure authoritative servers to refuse to answer queries for any zones for which they are not authoritative. This is more efficient for the server and allows it to spend more of its resources doing what its intended purpose is, answering authoritatively for its zone. |
| V-58543 | DnsServerSettingRule | xDnsServerSetting | Without a means for identifying the individual that produced the information, the information cannot be relied upon. Identifying the validity of information may be delayed or deterred. This requirement ensures organizational personnel have a means to identify who produced or changed specific information in transfers, zone information, or DNS configuration changes. |
| V-58549 | DnsServerSettingRule | None | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. |
| V-58579 | DnsServerSettingRule | xDnsServerSetting | A potential vulnerability of DNS is that an attacker can poison a name server's cache by sending queries that will cause the server to obtain host-to-IP address mappings from bogus name servers that respond with incorrect information. Once a name server has been poisoned, legitimate clients may be directed to non-existent hosts (which constitutes a denial of service), or, worse, hosts that masquerade as legitimate ones to obtain sensitive data or passwords. To guard against poisoning, name servers authoritative for .mil domains should be separated functionally from name servers that resolve queries on behalf of internal clients. Organizations may achieve this separation by dedicating machines to each function or, if possible, by running two instances of the name server software on the same machine: one for the authoritative function and the other for the resolving function. In this design, each name server process may be bound to a different IP address or network interface to implement the required segregation. |
| V-58581 | DnsServerSettingRule | None | A potential vulnerability of DNS is that an attacker can poison a name server's cache by sending queries that will cause the server to obtain host-to-IP address mappings from bogus name servers that respond with incorrect information. Once a name server has been poisoned, legitimate clients may be directed to non-existent hosts (which constitutes a denial of service), or, worse, hosts that masquerade as legitimate ones to obtain sensitive data or passwords.

| V-58553.a | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. Since the configuration of the audit logs on the DNS server dictates which events are logged for the purposes of correlating events, the permissions for configuring the audit logs must be restricted to only those with the role of ISSM or those appointed by the ISSM. |
| V-58641 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information. If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user. Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys. SIG(0) is used for server-to-server authentication for DNS transactions, and it uses PKI-based authentication. So, in cases where SIG(0) is being used instead of TSIG (which uses a shared key, not PKI-based authentication), this requirement is applicable. |
| V-58643 | PermissionRule | None | To enable zone transfer (requests and responses) through authenticated messages, it is necessary to generate a key for every pair of name servers. The key can also be used for securing other transactions, such as dynamic updates, DNS queries, and responses. The binary key string that is generated by most key generation utilities used with DNSSEC is Base64-encoded. TSIG is a string used to generate the message authentication hash stored in a TSIG RR and used to authenticate an entire DNS message. |
| V-58645 | PermissionRule | None | To enable zone transfer (requests and responses) through authenticated messages, it is necessary to generate a key for every pair of name servers. The key can also be used for securing other transactions, such as dynamic updates, DNS queries, and responses. The binary key string that is generated by most key generation utilities used with DNSSEC is Base64-encoded. TSIG is a string used to generate the message authentication hash stored in a TSIG RR and used to authenticate an entire DNS message. |
| V-58627 | RegistryRule | Registry | To prevent the possibility of a denial of service in relation to an IPv4 DNS server trying to respond to IPv6 requests, the server should be configured not to listen on any of its IPv6 interfaces unless it does contain IPv6 AAAA resource records in one of the zones. |
| V-58553.b | UserRightRule | UserRightsAssignment | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. Since the configuration of the audit logs on the DNS server dictates which events are logged for the purposes of correlating events, the permissions for configuring the audit logs must be restricted to only those with the role of ISSM or those appointed by the ISSM. |
| V-58697.a | UserRightRule | UserRightsAssignment | Applications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use an authorized application to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. For example, applications may include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks. |
| V-58697.b | UserRightRule | UserRightsAssignment | Applications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use an authorized application to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. For example, applications may include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks. |

| V-58555 | WinEventLogRule | xWinEventLog | Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server. In order to compile an accurate risk assessment, it is essential for security personnel to know what is being performed on the system, where an event occurred, when an event occurred, and by whom the event was triggered.

Data required to be captured include: whether an event was successful or failed, the event type or category, timestamps for when the event occurred, where the event originated, who/what initiated the event, affect the event had on the DNS implementation and any processes associated with the event. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-1097 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user logon. |
| V-1098 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. |
| V-1099 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-1104 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-1105 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-1107 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is 24 for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-1150 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least 3 of the 4 types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters), as well as preventing the inclusion of user names or parts of. |
| V-2372 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-2376 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This policy setting determines whether the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) validates every request for a session ticket against the user rights policy of the target computer. The policy is enabled by default which is the most secure setting for validating access to target resources is not circumvented. |
| V-2377 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum amount of time (in minutes) that a granted session ticket can be used to access a particular service. Session tickets are used only to authenticate new connections with servers. Ongoing operations are not interrupted if the session ticket used to authenticate the connection expires during the connection. |
| V-2378 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | In Kerberos, there are 2 types of tickets: Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and Service Tickets. Kerberos tickets have a limited lifetime so the time an attacker has to implement an attack is limited. This policy controls how long TGTs can be renewed. With Kerberos, the user's initial authentication to the domain controller results in a TGT which is then used to request Service Tickets to resources. Upon startup, each computer gets a TGT before requesting a service ticket to the domain controller and any other computers it needs to access. For services that startup under a specified user account, users must always get a TGT first, then get Service Tickets to all computers and services accessed. |
| V-2379 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user's TGT may be renewed. This security configuration limits the amount of time an attacker has to crack the TGT and gain access. |
| V-2380 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum time difference (in minutes) that Kerberos will tolerate between the time on a client's clock and the time on a server's clock while still considering the two clocks synchronous. In order to prevent replay attacks, Kerberos uses timestamps as part of its protocol definition. For timestamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the server need to be in sync as much as possible. |
| V-6836 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-26529 | AuditPolicyRule | AuditPolicySubcategory | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior.

| V-39331 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Improper access permissions for directory data files could allow unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete directory data. The SYSVOL directory contains public files (to the domain) such as policies and logon scripts. Data in shared subdirectories are replicated to all domain controllers in a domain. |
| V-40177.a | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications.

| V-57721 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information. Operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order to make access decisions regarding the modification or deletion of audit tools. |
| V-1075 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the shutdown button may allow individuals to shut down a system anonymously. Only authenticated users should be allowed to shut down the system. Preventing display of this button in the logon dialog box ensures that individuals who shut down the system are authorized and tracked in the system's Security event log. |
| V-1089 | RegistryRule | Registry | Failure to display the logon banner prior to a logon attempt will negate legal proceedings resulting from unauthorized access to system resources. |
| V-1090 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default Windows configuration caches the last logon credentials for users who log on interactively to a system. This feature is provided for system availability reasons, such as the user's machine being disconnected from the network or domain controllers being unavailable. Even though the credential cache is well-protected, if a system is attacked, an unauthorized individual may isolate the password to a domain user account using a password-cracking program and gain access to the domain. |
| V-1093 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-1136 | RegistryRule | Registry | Users must not be permitted to remain logged on to the network after they have exceeded their permitted logon hours. In many cases, this indicates that a user forgot to log off before leaving for the day. However, it may also indicate that a user is attempting unauthorized access at a time when the system may be less closely monitored. Forcibly disconnecting users when logon hours expire protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-1141 | RegistryRule | Registry | Some non-Microsoft SMB servers only support unencrypted (plain text) password authentication. Sending plain text passwords across the network, when authenticating to an SMB server, reduces the overall security of the environment. Check with the vendor of the SMB server to see if there is a way to support encrypted password authentication. |
| V-1145 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing a system to automatically log on when the machine is booted could give access to any unauthorized individual who restarts the computer. Automatic logon with administrator privileges would give full access to an unauthorized individual. |
| V-1151 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing users to install drivers can introduce malware or cause the instability of a system. Print driver installation should be restricted to administrators. |
| V-1153 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to stand-alone computers that are running later versions. |
| V-1154 | RegistryRule | Registry | abling the Ctrl+Alt+Del security attention sequence can compromise system security. Because only Windows responds to the Ctrl+Alt+Del security sequence, a user can be assured that any passwords entered following that sequence are sent only to Windows. If the sequence requirement is eliminated, malicious programs can request and receive a user's Windows password. Disabling this sequence also suppresses a custom logon banner. |
| V-1157 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and must be locked. Configuring a system to lock when a smart card is removed will ensure the system is inaccessible when unattended. |
| V-1162 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. |
| V-1163 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted. |
| V-1164 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but the channel is not integrity checked. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be signed. |
| V-1165 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. Disabling automatic password changes can make the system more vulnerable to malicious access. Frequent password changes can be a significant safeguard for your system. A new password for the computer account will be generated every 30 days. |
| V-1166 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will request packet signing when communicating with an SMB server that is enabled or required to perform SMB packet signing. |
| V-1171 | RegistryRule | Registry | Removable hard drives, if they are not properly configured, can be formatted and ejected by users who are not members of the Administrators Group. Formatting and ejecting removable NTFS media must only be done by administrators. |
| V-1172 | RegistryRule | Registry | Creating strong passwords that can be remembered by users requires some thought. By giving the user advance warning, the user has time to construct a sufficiently strong password. This setting configures the system to display a warning to users telling them how many days are left before their password expires. |
| V-1173 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions. If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing nonadministrative users to read shared objects, but not modify shared objects that they did not create. |
| V-1174 | RegistryRule | Registry | Open sessions can increase the avenues of attack on a system. This setting is used to control when a computer disconnects an inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished. This protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-2374 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing Autoplay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system. Autoplay begins reading from a drive as soon media is inserted into the drive. As a result, the setup file of programs or music on audio media may start. By default, Autoplay is disabled on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive) and on network drives. Enabling this policy disables Autoplay on all drives. |
| V-3338 | RegistryRule | Registry | Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously provide the potential for gaining unauthorized system access. Pipes are internal system communications processes. They are identified internally by ID numbers that vary between systems. To make access to these processes easier, these pipes are given names that do not vary between systems. This setting controls which of these pipes anonymous users may access. |
| V-3339 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-3340 | RegistryRule | Registry | Anonymous access to network shares provides the potential for gaining unauthorized system access by network users. This could lead to the exposure or corruption of sensitive data. |
| V-3343 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Solicited assistance is help that is specifically requested by the local user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3344 | RegistryRule | Registry | An account without a password can allow unauthorized access to a system as only the username would be required. Password policies should prevent accounts with blank passwords from existing on a system. However, if a local account with a blank password did exist, enabling this setting will prevent network access, limiting the account to local console logon only. |
| V-3373 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. This setting controls the maximum password age that a machine account may have. This setting must be set to no more than 30 days, ensuring the machine changes its password monthly. |
| V-3374 | RegistryRule | Registry | A computer connecting to a domain controller will establish a secure channel. Requiring strong session keys enforces 128-bit encryption between systems. |
| V-3377 | RegistryRule | Registry | Access by anonymous users must be restricted. If this setting is enabled, then anonymous users have the same rights and permissions as the built-in Everyone group. Anonymous users must not have these permissions or rights. |
| V-3378 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows includes two network-sharing security models - Classic and Guest only. With the Classic model, local accounts must be password protected; otherwise, anyone can use guest user accounts to access shared system resources. |
| V-3379 | RegistryRule | Registry | The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether or not a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-3381 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the signing requirements for LDAP clients. This setting must be set to Negotiate signing or Require signing, depending on the environment and type of LDAP server in use. |
| V-3382 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-3383 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting ensures that the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing. FIPS-compliant algorithms meet specific standards established by the U.S. Government and must be the algorithms used for all OS encryption functions. |
| V-3385 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the behavior of non-Windows subsystems when dealing with the case of arguments or commands. Case sensitivity could lead to the access of files or commands that must be restricted. To prevent this from happening, case insensitivity restrictions must be required. |
| V-3449 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing multiple Remote Desktop Services sessions could consume resources. There is also potential to make a secondary connection to a system with compromised credentials. |
| V-3453 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls the ability of users to supply passwords automatically as part of their remote desktop connection. Disabling this setting would allow anyone to use the stored credentials in a connection item to connect to the terminal server. |
| V-3454 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote connections must be encrypted to prevent interception of data or sensitive information. Selecting "High Level" will ensure encryption of Remote Desktop Services sessions in both directions. |
| V-3455 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If a communal temporary folder is used for remote desktop sessions, it might be possible for users to access other users' temporary folders. If this setting is enabled, only one temporary folder is used for all remote desktop sessions. Per session temporary folders must be established. |
| V-3456 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote desktop session temporary folders must always be deleted after a session is over to prevent hard disk clutter and potential leakage of information. This setting controls the deletion of the temporary folders when the session is terminated. |
| V-3469 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If this setting is enabled, then Group Policy settings are not refreshed while a user is currently logged on. This could lead to instances when a user does not have the latest changes to a policy applied and is therefore operating in an insecure context. |
| V-3470 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Unsolicited remote assistance is help that is offered by the remote user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3479 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default search behavior, when an application calls a function in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), is to search the current directory, followed by the directories contained in the system's path environment variable. An unauthorized DLL, inserted into an application's working directory, could allow malicious code to be run on the system. Setting this policy value forces the system to search the %Systemroot% for the DLL before searching the current directory or the rest of the path. |
| V-3480 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Uncontrolled system updates can introduce issues to a system. The automatic check for updates performed by Windows Media Player must be disabled to ensure a constant platform and to prevent the introduction of unknown\untested software on the system. |
| V-3481 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Windows Media Player uses software components, referred to as Codecs, to play back media files. By default, when an unknown file type is opened with the Media Player, it will search the Internet for the appropriate Codec and automatically download it. To ensure platform consistency and to protect against new vulnerabilities associated with media types, all Codecs must be installed by the System Administrator. |
| V-3666 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-4108 | RegistryRule | Registry | When the audit log reaches a given percent full, an audit event is written to the security log. It is recorded as a successful audit event under the category of System. This option may be especially useful if the audit logs are set to be cleared manually. |
| V-4110 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to disable IP source routing protects against spoofing. |
| V-4111 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing ICMP redirect of routes can lead to traffic not being routed properly. When disabled, this forces ICMP to be routed via shortest path first. |
| V-4112 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) is used to detect and configure default gateway addresses on the computer. If a router is impersonated on a network, traffic could be routed through the compromised system. |
| V-4113 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls how often TCP sends a keep-alive packet in attempting to verify that an idle connection is still intact. A higher value could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service with numerous connections. |
| V-4116 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the servers WINS resolution capability. |
| V-4407 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man in the middle attacks where an intruder captures packets between the server and the client and modifies them before forwarding them to the client. In the case of an LDAP server, this means that an attacker could cause a client to make decisions based on false records from the LDAP directory. You can lower the risk of an attacker pulling this off in a corporate network by implementing strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Furthermore, implementing Internet Protocol security (IPSec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, can make all types of man in the middle attacks extremely difficult. |
| V-4408 | RegistryRule | Registry | Enabling this setting on all domain controllers in a domain prevents domain members from changing their computer account passwords. If these passwords are weak or compromised, the inability to change them may leave these computers vulnerable. |
| V-4438 | RegistryRule | Registry | In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a continuous stream of SYN packets to a server, and the server leaves the half-open connections open until it is overwhelmed and is no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. |
| V-4442 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing more than several seconds makes the computer vulnerable to a potential attack from someone walking up to the console to attempt to log on to the system before the lock takes effect. |
| V-4443 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths and sub-paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-4445 | RegistryRule | Registry | The POSIX subsystem is an Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard that defines a set of operating system services. The POSIX Subsystem is required if the server supports applications that use that subsystem. The subsystem introduces a security risk relating to processes that can potentially persist across logins. That is, if a user starts a process and then logs out, there is a potential that the next user who logs in to the system could access the previous users process. This is dangerous because the process started by the first user may retain that users system privileges, and anything the second user does with that process will be performed with the privileges of the first user. |
| V-4447 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing unsecure RPC communication exposes the system to man-in-the-middle attacks and data disclosure attacks. A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an intruder captures packets between a client and server and modifies them before allowing the packets to be exchanged. Usually the attacker will modify the information in the packets in an attempt to cause either the client or server to reveal sensitive information. |
| V-4448 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enabling this setting and then selecting the "Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed" option ensures that the policies will be reprocessed even if none have been changed. This way, any unauthorized changes are forced to match the domain-based group policy settings again. |
| V-6831 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted and signed. |
| V-6832 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will only communicate with an SMB server that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6833 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will only communicate with an SMB client that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6834 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |
| V-8322.a | RegistryRule | Registry | When a directory service using multi-master replication (such as AD) executes on computers that do not have synchronized time, directory data may be corrupted or updated invalidly. The lack of synchronized time could lead to audit log data that is misleading, inconclusive, or unusable. In cases of intrusion this may invalidate the audit data as a source of forensic evidence in an incident investigation. In AD, the lack of synchronized time could prevent clients from logging on or accessing server resources as a result of Kerberos requirements related to time variance. |
| V-8322.b | RegistryRule | Registry | When a directory service using multi-master replication (such as AD) executes on computers that do not have synchronized time, directory data may be corrupted or updated invalidly. The lack of synchronized time could lead to audit log data that is misleading, inconclusive, or unusable. In cases of intrusion this may invalidate the audit data as a source of forensic evidence in an incident investigation. In AD, the lack of synchronized time could prevent clients from logging on or accessing server resources as a result of Kerberos requirements related to time variance. |
| V-8324 | RegistryRule | Registry | When a time synchronization tool executes, it may switch between time sources according to network or server contention. If switches between time sources are not logged, it may be difficult or impossible to detect malicious activity or availability problems. |
| V-11806 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the username of the last logged on user provides half of the userid/password equation that an unauthorized person would need to gain access. The username of the last user to log on to a system must not be displayed. |
| V-14228 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from setting up a default system access control list for certain system objects, which could create a very large number of security events, filling the security log in Windows and making it difficult to identify actual issues. |
| V-14229 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from generating audit events for every file backed up or restored, which could fill the security log in Windows, making it difficult to identify actual issues. |
| V-14230 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting allows administrators to enable more precise auditing capabilities. |
| V-14232 | RegistryRule | Registry | IPSec exemption filters allow specific traffic that may be needed by the system for such things as Kerberos authentication. This setting configures Windows for specific IPSec exemptions. |
| V-14234 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the built-in Administrator account so that it runs in Admin Approval Mode. |
| V-14235 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the elevation requirements for logged on administrators to complete a task that requires raised privileges. |
| V-14236 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting controls the behavior of elevation when requested by a standard user account. |
| V-14237 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting requires Windows to respond to application installation requests by prompting for credentials. |
| V-14239 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures Windows to only allow applications installed in a secure location on the file system, such as the Program Files or the Windows\System32 folders, to run with elevated privileges. |
| V-14240 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting enables UAC. |
| V-14241 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting ensures that the elevation prompt is only used in secure desktop mode. |
| V-14242 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures non-UAC-compliant applications to run in virtualized file and registry entries in per-user locations, allowing them to run. |
| V-14243 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enumeration of administrator accounts when elevating can provide part of the logon information to an unauthorized user. This setting configures the system to always require users to enter in a username and password to elevate a running application. |
| V-14247 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Saving passwords in the Remote Desktop Client could allow an unauthorized user to establish a remote desktop session to another system. The system must be configured to prevent users from saving passwords in the Remote Desktop Client. |
| V-14249 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Preventing users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to Remote Session Hosts that they access helps reduce possible exposure of sensitive data. |
| V-14259 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-1097 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user logon. |
| V-1098 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. |
| V-1099 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-1104 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-1105 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-1107 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is 24 for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-1150 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least 3 of the 4 types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters), as well as preventing the inclusion of user names or parts of. |
| V-2372 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-2376 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This policy setting determines whether the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) validates every request for a session ticket against the user rights policy of the target computer. The policy is enabled by default which is the most secure setting for validating access to target resources is not circumvented. |
| V-2377 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum amount of time (in minutes) that a granted session ticket can be used to access a particular service. Session tickets are used only to authenticate new connections with servers. Ongoing operations are not interrupted if the session ticket used to authenticate the connection expires during the connection. |
| V-2378 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | In Kerberos, there are 2 types of tickets: Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and Service Tickets. Kerberos tickets have a limited lifetime so the time an attacker has to implement an attack is limited. This policy controls how long TGTs can be renewed. With Kerberos, the user's initial authentication to the domain controller results in a TGT which is then used to request Service Tickets to resources. Upon startup, each computer gets a TGT before requesting a service ticket to the domain controller and any other computers it needs to access. For services that startup under a specified user account, users must always get a TGT first, then get Service Tickets to all computers and services accessed. |
| V-2379 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user's TGT may be renewed. This security configuration limits the amount of time an attacker has to crack the TGT and gain access. |
| V-2380 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum time difference (in minutes) that Kerberos will tolerate between the time on a client's clock and the time on a server's clock while still considering the two clocks synchronous. In order to prevent replay attacks, Kerberos uses timestamps as part of its protocol definition. For timestamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the server need to be in sync as much as possible. |
| V-6836 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-26529 | AuditPolicyRule | AuditPolicySubcategory | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks.

| V-39331 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Improper access permissions for directory data files could allow unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete directory data. The SYSVOL directory contains public files (to the domain) such as policies and logon scripts. Data in shared subdirectories are replicated to all domain controllers in a domain. |
| V-40177.a | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications.

| V-57721 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information. Operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order to make access decisions regarding the modification or deletion of audit tools. |
| V-1075 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the shutdown button may allow individuals to shut down a system anonymously. Only authenticated users should be allowed to shut down the system. Preventing display of this button in the logon dialog box ensures that individuals who shut down the system are authorized and tracked in the system's Security event log. |
| V-1089 | RegistryRule | Registry | Failure to display the logon banner prior to a logon attempt will negate legal proceedings resulting from unauthorized access to system resources. |
| V-1090 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default Windows configuration caches the last logon credentials for users who log on interactively to a system. This feature is provided for system availability reasons, such as the user's machine being disconnected from the network or domain controllers being unavailable. Even though the credential cache is well-protected, if a system is attacked, an unauthorized individual may isolate the password to a domain user account using a password-cracking program and gain access to the domain. |
| V-1093 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-1136 | RegistryRule | Registry | Users must not be permitted to remain logged on to the network after they have exceeded their permitted logon hours. In many cases, this indicates that a user forgot to log off before leaving for the day. However, it may also indicate that a user is attempting unauthorized access at a time when the system may be less closely monitored. Forcibly disconnecting users when logon hours expire protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-1141 | RegistryRule | Registry | Some non-Microsoft SMB servers only support unencrypted (plain text) password authentication. Sending plain text passwords across the network, when authenticating to an SMB server, reduces the overall security of the environment. Check with the vendor of the SMB server to see if there is a way to support encrypted password authentication. |
| V-1145 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing a system to automatically log on when the machine is booted could give access to any unauthorized individual who restarts the computer. Automatic logon with administrator privileges would give full access to an unauthorized individual. |
| V-1151 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing users to install drivers can introduce malware or cause the instability of a system. Print driver installation should be restricted to administrators. |
| V-1153 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to stand-alone computers that are running later versions. |
| V-1154 | RegistryRule | Registry | abling the Ctrl+Alt+Del security attention sequence can compromise system security. Because only Windows responds to the Ctrl+Alt+Del security sequence, a user can be assured that any passwords entered following that sequence are sent only to Windows. If the sequence requirement is eliminated, malicious programs can request and receive a user's Windows password. Disabling this sequence also suppresses a custom logon banner. |
| V-1157 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and must be locked. Configuring a system to lock when a smart card is removed will ensure the system is inaccessible when unattended. |
| V-1162 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. |
| V-1163 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted. |
| V-1164 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but the channel is not integrity checked. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be signed. |
| V-1165 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. Disabling automatic password changes can make the system more vulnerable to malicious access. Frequent password changes can be a significant safeguard for your system. A new password for the computer account will be generated every 30 days. |
| V-1166 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will request packet signing when communicating with an SMB server that is enabled or required to perform SMB packet signing. |
| V-1171 | RegistryRule | Registry | Removable hard drives, if they are not properly configured, can be formatted and ejected by users who are not members of the Administrators Group. Formatting and ejecting removable NTFS media must only be done by administrators. |
| V-1172 | RegistryRule | Registry | Creating strong passwords that can be remembered by users requires some thought. By giving the user advance warning, the user has time to construct a sufficiently strong password. This setting configures the system to display a warning to users telling them how many days are left before their password expires. |
| V-1173 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions. If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing nonadministrative users to read shared objects, but not modify shared objects that they did not create. |
| V-1174 | RegistryRule | Registry | Open sessions can increase the avenues of attack on a system. This setting is used to control when a computer disconnects an inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished. This protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-2374 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing Autoplay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system. Autoplay begins reading from a drive as soon media is inserted into the drive. As a result, the setup file of programs or music on audio media may start. By default, Autoplay is disabled on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive) and on network drives. Enabling this policy disables Autoplay on all drives. |
| V-3338 | RegistryRule | Registry | Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously provide the potential for gaining unauthorized system access. Pipes are internal system communications processes. They are identified internally by ID numbers that vary between systems. To make access to these processes easier, these pipes are given names that do not vary between systems. This setting controls which of these pipes anonymous users may access. |
| V-3339 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-3340 | RegistryRule | Registry | Anonymous access to network shares provides the potential for gaining unauthorized system access by network users. This could lead to the exposure or corruption of sensitive data. |
| V-3343 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Solicited assistance is help that is specifically requested by the local user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3344 | RegistryRule | Registry | An account without a password can allow unauthorized access to a system as only the username would be required. Password policies should prevent accounts with blank passwords from existing on a system. However, if a local account with a blank password did exist, enabling this setting will prevent network access, limiting the account to local console logon only. |
| V-3373 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. This setting controls the maximum password age that a machine account may have. This setting must be set to no more than 30 days, ensuring the machine changes its password monthly. |
| V-3374 | RegistryRule | Registry | A computer connecting to a domain controller will establish a secure channel. Requiring strong session keys enforces 128-bit encryption between systems. |
| V-3377 | RegistryRule | Registry | Access by anonymous users must be restricted. If this setting is enabled, then anonymous users have the same rights and permissions as the built-in Everyone group. Anonymous users must not have these permissions or rights. |
| V-3378 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows includes two network-sharing security models - Classic and Guest only. With the Classic model, local accounts must be password protected; otherwise, anyone can use guest user accounts to access shared system resources. |
| V-3379 | RegistryRule | Registry | The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether or not a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-3381 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the signing requirements for LDAP clients. This setting must be set to Negotiate signing or Require signing, depending on the environment and type of LDAP server in use. |
| V-3382 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-3383 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting ensures that the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing. FIPS-compliant algorithms meet specific standards established by the U.S. Government and must be the algorithms used for all OS encryption functions. |
| V-3385 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the behavior of non-Windows subsystems when dealing with the case of arguments or commands. Case sensitivity could lead to the access of files or commands that must be restricted. To prevent this from happening, case insensitivity restrictions must be required. |
| V-3449 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing multiple Remote Desktop Services sessions could consume resources. There is also potential to make a secondary connection to a system with compromised credentials. |
| V-3453 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls the ability of users to supply passwords automatically as part of their remote desktop connection. Disabling this setting would allow anyone to use the stored credentials in a connection item to connect to the terminal server. |
| V-3454 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote connections must be encrypted to prevent interception of data or sensitive information. Selecting "High Level" will ensure encryption of Remote Desktop Services sessions in both directions. |
| V-3455 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If a communal temporary folder is used for remote desktop sessions, it might be possible for users to access other users' temporary folders. If this setting is enabled, only one temporary folder is used for all remote desktop sessions. Per session temporary folders must be established. |
| V-3456 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote desktop session temporary folders must always be deleted after a session is over to prevent hard disk clutter and potential leakage of information. This setting controls the deletion of the temporary folders when the session is terminated. |
| V-3469 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If this setting is enabled, then Group Policy settings are not refreshed while a user is currently logged on. This could lead to instances when a user does not have the latest changes to a policy applied and is therefore operating in an insecure context. |
| V-3470 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Unsolicited remote assistance is help that is offered by the remote user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3479 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default search behavior, when an application calls a function in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), is to search the current directory, followed by the directories contained in the system's path environment variable. An unauthorized DLL, inserted into an application's working directory, could allow malicious code to be run on the system. Setting this policy value forces the system to search the %Systemroot% for the DLL before searching the current directory or the rest of the path. |
| V-3480 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Uncontrolled system updates can introduce issues to a system. The automatic check for updates performed by Windows Media Player must be disabled to ensure a constant platform and to prevent the introduction of unknown\untested software on the system. |
| V-3481 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Windows Media Player uses software components, referred to as Codecs, to play back media files. By default, when an unknown file type is opened with the Media Player, it will search the Internet for the appropriate Codec and automatically download it. To ensure platform consistency and to protect against new vulnerabilities associated with media types, all Codecs must be installed by the System Administrator. |
| V-3666 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-4108 | RegistryRule | Registry | When the audit log reaches a given percent full, an audit event is written to the security log. It is recorded as a successful audit event under the category of System. This option may be especially useful if the audit logs are set to be cleared manually. |
| V-4110 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to disable IP source routing protects against spoofing. |
| V-4111 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing ICMP redirect of routes can lead to traffic not being routed properly. When disabled, this forces ICMP to be routed via shortest path first. |
| V-4112 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) is used to detect and configure default gateway addresses on the computer. If a router is impersonated on a network, traffic could be routed through the compromised system. |
| V-4113 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls how often TCP sends a keep-alive packet in attempting to verify that an idle connection is still intact. A higher value could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service with numerous connections. |
| V-4116 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the servers WINS resolution capability. |
| V-4407 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man in the middle attacks where an intruder captures packets between the server and the client and modifies them before forwarding them to the client. In the case of an LDAP server, this means that an attacker could cause a client to make decisions based on false records from the LDAP directory. You can lower the risk of an attacker pulling this off in a corporate network by implementing strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Furthermore, implementing Internet Protocol security (IPSec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, can make all types of man in the middle attacks extremely difficult. |
| V-4408 | RegistryRule | Registry | Enabling this setting on all domain controllers in a domain prevents domain members from changing their computer account passwords. If these passwords are weak or compromised, the inability to change them may leave these computers vulnerable. |
| V-4438 | RegistryRule | Registry | In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a continuous stream of SYN packets to a server, and the server leaves the half-open connections open until it is overwhelmed and is no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. |
| V-4442 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing more than several seconds makes the computer vulnerable to a potential attack from someone walking up to the console to attempt to log on to the system before the lock takes effect. |
| V-4443 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths and sub-paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-4445 | RegistryRule | Registry | The POSIX subsystem is an Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard that defines a set of operating system services. The POSIX Subsystem is required if the server supports applications that use that subsystem. The subsystem introduces a security risk relating to processes that can potentially persist across logins. That is, if a user starts a process and then logs out, there is a potential that the next user who logs in to the system could access the previous users process. This is dangerous because the process started by the first user may retain that users system privileges, and anything the second user does with that process will be performed with the privileges of the first user. |
| V-4447 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing unsecure RPC communication exposes the system to man-in-the-middle attacks and data disclosure attacks. A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an intruder captures packets between a client and server and modifies them before allowing the packets to be exchanged. Usually the attacker will modify the information in the packets in an attempt to cause either the client or server to reveal sensitive information. |
| V-4448 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enabling this setting and then selecting the "Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed" option ensures that the policies will be reprocessed even if none have been changed. This way, any unauthorized changes are forced to match the domain-based group policy settings again. |
| V-6831 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted and signed. |
| V-6832 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will only communicate with an SMB server that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6833 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will only communicate with an SMB client that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6834 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |
| V-8322.a | RegistryRule | Registry | When a directory service using multi-master replication (such as AD) executes on computers that do not have synchronized time, directory data may be corrupted or updated invalidly. The lack of synchronized time could lead to audit log data that is misleading, inconclusive, or unusable. In cases of intrusion this may invalidate the audit data as a source of forensic evidence in an incident investigation. In AD, the lack of synchronized time could prevent clients from logging on or accessing server resources as a result of Kerberos requirements related to time variance. |
| V-8322.b | RegistryRule | Registry | When a directory service using multi-master replication (such as AD) executes on computers that do not have synchronized time, directory data may be corrupted or updated invalidly. The lack of synchronized time could lead to audit log data that is misleading, inconclusive, or unusable. In cases of intrusion this may invalidate the audit data as a source of forensic evidence in an incident investigation. In AD, the lack of synchronized time could prevent clients from logging on or accessing server resources as a result of Kerberos requirements related to time variance. |
| V-8324 | RegistryRule | Registry | When a time synchronization tool executes, it may switch between time sources according to network or server contention. If switches between time sources are not logged, it may be difficult or impossible to detect malicious activity or availability problems. |
| V-11806 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the username of the last logged on user provides half of the userid/password equation that an unauthorized person would need to gain access. The username of the last user to log on to a system must not be displayed. |
| V-14228 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from setting up a default system access control list for certain system objects, which could create a very large number of security events, filling the security log in Windows and making it difficult to identify actual issues. |
| V-14229 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from generating audit events for every file backed up or restored, which could fill the security log in Windows, making it difficult to identify actual issues. |
| V-14230 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting allows administrators to enable more precise auditing capabilities. |
| V-14232 | RegistryRule | Registry | IPSec exemption filters allow specific traffic that may be needed by the system for such things as Kerberos authentication. This setting configures Windows for specific IPSec exemptions. |
| V-14234 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the built-in Administrator account so that it runs in Admin Approval Mode. |
| V-14235 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the elevation requirements for logged on administrators to complete a task that requires raised privileges. |
| V-14236 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting controls the behavior of elevation when requested by a standard user account. |
| V-14237 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting requires Windows to respond to application installation requests by prompting for credentials. |
| V-14239 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures Windows to only allow applications installed in a secure location on the file system, such as the Program Files or the Windows\System32 folders, to run with elevated privileges. |
| V-14240 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting enables UAC. |
| V-14241 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting ensures that the elevation prompt is only used in secure desktop mode. |
| V-14242 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures non-UAC-compliant applications to run in virtualized file and registry entries in per-user locations, allowing them to run. |
| V-14243 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enumeration of administrator accounts when elevating can provide part of the logon information to an unauthorized user. This setting configures the system to always require users to enter in a username and password to elevate a running application. |
| V-14247 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Saving passwords in the Remote Desktop Client could allow an unauthorized user to establish a remote desktop session to another system. The system must be configured to prevent users from saving passwords in the Remote Desktop Client. |
| V-14249 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Preventing users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to Remote Session Hosts that they access helps reduce possible exposure of sensitive data. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-1097 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user logon. |
| V-1098 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. |

| V-1104 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-1105 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-1107 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is 24 for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-1150 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack.

| V-1152 | PermissionRule | RegistryAccessEntry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require anonymous access to the registry. This must be limited to properly protect the system. |
| V-26070 | PermissionRule | RegistryAccessEntry | Permissions on the Winlogon registry key must only allow privileged accounts to change registry values. If standard users have these permissions, there is a potential for programs to run with elevated privileges when a privileged user logs on to the system. |
| V-32282 | PermissionRule | RegistryAccessEntry | Permissions on the Active Setup\Installed Components registry key must only allow privileged accounts to add or change registry values. If standard user accounts have these permissions, there is a potential for programs to run with elevated privileges when a privileged user logs on to the system. |
| V-36722 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. The Application event log may be susceptible to tampering if proper permissions are not applied. |
| V-36723 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. The Security event log may disclose sensitive information or be susceptible to tampering if proper permissions are not applied. |
| V-36724 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. The System event log may be susceptible to tampering if proper permissions are not applied. |
| V-40177.a | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-40177.b | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-40178 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-40179 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-57721 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information. Operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order to make access decisions regarding the modification or deletion of audit tools. |
| V-1075 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the shutdown button may allow individuals to shut down a system anonymously. Only authenticated users should be allowed to shut down the system. Preventing display of this button in the logon dialog box ensures that individuals who shut down the system are authorized and tracked in the system's Security event log. |
| V-1089 | RegistryRule | Registry | Failure to display the logon banner prior to a logon attempt will negate legal proceedings resulting from unauthorized access to system resources. |
| V-1090 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default Windows configuration caches the last logon credentials for users who log on interactively to a system. This feature is provided for system availability reasons, such as the user's machine being disconnected from the network or domain controllers being unavailable. Even though the credential cache is well-protected, if a system is attacked, an unauthorized individual may isolate the password to a domain user account using a password-cracking program and gain access to the domain. |
| V-1093 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-1136 | RegistryRule | Registry | Users must not be permitted to remain logged on to the network after they have exceeded their permitted logon hours. In many cases, this indicates that a user forgot to log off before leaving for the day. However, it may also indicate that a user is attempting unauthorized access at a time when the system may be less closely monitored. Forcibly disconnecting users when logon hours expire protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-1141 | RegistryRule | Registry | Some non-Microsoft SMB servers only support unencrypted (plain text) password authentication. Sending plain text passwords across the network, when authenticating to an SMB server, reduces the overall security of the environment. Check with the vendor of the SMB server to see if there is a way to support encrypted password authentication. |
| V-1145 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing a system to automatically log on when the machine is booted could give access to any unauthorized individual who restarts the computer. Automatic logon with administrator privileges would give full access to an unauthorized individual. |
| V-1151 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing users to install drivers can introduce malware or cause the instability of a system. Print driver installation should be restricted to administrators. |
| V-1153 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to stand-alone computers that are running later versions. |
| V-1154 | RegistryRule | Registry | abling the Ctrl+Alt+Del security attention sequence can compromise system security. Because only Windows responds to the Ctrl+Alt+Del security sequence, a user can be assured that any passwords entered following that sequence are sent only to Windows. If the sequence requirement is eliminated, malicious programs can request and receive a user's Windows password. Disabling this sequence also suppresses a custom logon banner. |
| V-1157 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and must be locked. Configuring a system to lock when a smart card is removed will ensure the system is inaccessible when unattended. |
| V-1162 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. |
| V-1163 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted. |
| V-1164 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but the channel is not integrity checked. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be signed. |
| V-1165 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. Disabling automatic password changes can make the system more vulnerable to malicious access. Frequent password changes can be a significant safeguard for your system. A new password for the computer account will be generated every 30 days. |
| V-1166 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will request packet signing when communicating with an SMB server that is enabled or required to perform SMB packet signing. |
| V-1171 | RegistryRule | Registry | Removable hard drives, if they are not properly configured, can be formatted and ejected by users who are not members of the Administrators Group. Formatting and ejecting removable NTFS media must only be done by administrators. |
| V-1172 | RegistryRule | Registry | Creating strong passwords that can be remembered by users requires some thought. By giving the user advance warning, the user has time to construct a sufficiently strong password. This setting configures the system to display a warning to users telling them how many days are left before their password expires. |
| V-1173 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions. If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing nonadministrative users to read shared objects, but not modify shared objects that they did not create. |
| V-1174 | RegistryRule | Registry | Open sessions can increase the avenues of attack on a system. This setting is used to control when a computer disconnects an inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished. This protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-2374 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing Autoplay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system. Autoplay begins reading from a drive as soon media is inserted into the drive. As a result, the setup file of programs or music on audio media may start. By default, Autoplay is disabled on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive) and on network drives. Enabling this policy disables Autoplay on all drives. |
| V-3338 | RegistryRule | Registry | Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously provide the potential for gaining unauthorized system access. Pipes are internal system communications processes. They are identified internally by ID numbers that vary between systems. To make access to these processes easier, these pipes are given names that do not vary between systems. This setting controls which of these pipes anonymous users may access. |
| V-3339 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-3340 | RegistryRule | Registry | Anonymous access to network shares provides the potential for gaining unauthorized system access by network users. This could lead to the exposure or corruption of sensitive data. |
| V-3343 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Solicited assistance is help that is specifically requested by the local user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3344 | RegistryRule | Registry | An account without a password can allow unauthorized access to a system as only the username would be required. Password policies should prevent accounts with blank passwords from existing on a system. However, if a local account with a blank password did exist, enabling this setting will prevent network access, limiting the account to local console logon only. |
| V-3373 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. This setting controls the maximum password age that a machine account may have. This setting must be set to no more than 30 days, ensuring the machine changes its password monthly. |
| V-3374 | RegistryRule | Registry | A computer connecting to a domain controller will establish a secure channel. Requiring strong session keys enforces 128-bit encryption between systems. |
| V-3377 | RegistryRule | Registry | Access by anonymous users must be restricted. If this setting is enabled, then anonymous users have the same rights and permissions as the built-in Everyone group. Anonymous users must not have these permissions or rights. |
| V-3378 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows includes two network-sharing security models - Classic and Guest only. With the Classic model, local accounts must be password protected; otherwise, anyone can use guest user accounts to access shared system resources. |
| V-3379 | RegistryRule | Registry | The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether or not a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-3381 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the signing requirements for LDAP clients. This setting must be set to Negotiate signing or Require signing, depending on the environment and type of LDAP server in use. |
| V-3382 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-3383 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting ensures that the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing. FIPS-compliant algorithms meet specific standards established by the U.S. Government and must be the algorithms used for all OS encryption functions. |
| V-3385 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the behavior of non-Windows subsystems when dealing with the case of arguments or commands. Case sensitivity could lead to the access of files or commands that must be restricted. To prevent this from happening, case insensitivity restrictions must be required. |
| V-3449 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing multiple Remote Desktop Services sessions could consume resources. There is also potential to make a secondary connection to a system with compromised credentials. |
| V-3453 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls the ability of users to supply passwords automatically as part of their remote desktop connection. Disabling this setting would allow anyone to use the stored credentials in a connection item to connect to the terminal server. |
| V-3454 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote connections must be encrypted to prevent interception of data or sensitive information. Selecting "High Level" will ensure encryption of Remote Desktop Services sessions in both directions. |
| V-3455 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If a communal temporary folder is used for remote desktop sessions, it might be possible for users to access other users' temporary folders. If this setting is enabled, only one temporary folder is used for all remote desktop sessions. Per session temporary folders must be established. |
| V-3456 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote desktop session temporary folders must always be deleted after a session is over to prevent hard disk clutter and potential leakage of information. This setting controls the deletion of the temporary folders when the session is terminated. |
| V-3469 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If this setting is enabled, then Group Policy settings are not refreshed while a user is currently logged on. This could lead to instances when a user does not have the latest changes to a policy applied and is therefore operating in an insecure context. |
| V-3470 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Unsolicited remote assistance is help that is offered by the remote user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3479 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default search behavior, when an application calls a function in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), is to search the current directory, followed by the directories contained in the system's path environment variable. An unauthorized DLL, inserted into an application's working directory, could allow malicious code to be run on the system. Setting this policy value forces the system to search the %Systemroot% for the DLL before searching the current directory or the rest of the path. |
| V-3480 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Uncontrolled system updates can introduce issues to a system. The automatic check for updates performed by Windows Media Player must be disabled to ensure a constant platform and to prevent the introduction of unknown\untested software on the system. |
| V-3481 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Windows Media Player uses software components, referred to as Codecs, to play back media files. By default, when an unknown file type is opened with the Media Player, it will search the Internet for the appropriate Codec and automatically download it. To ensure platform consistency and to protect against new vulnerabilities associated with media types, all Codecs must be installed by the System Administrator. |
| V-3666 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-4108 | RegistryRule | Registry | When the audit log reaches a given percent full, an audit event is written to the security log. It is recorded as a successful audit event under the category of System. This option may be especially useful if the audit logs are set to be cleared manually. |
| V-4110 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to disable IP source routing protects against spoofing. |
| V-4111 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing ICMP redirect of routes can lead to traffic not being routed properly. When disabled, this forces ICMP to be routed via shortest path first. |
| V-4112 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) is used to detect and configure default gateway addresses on the computer. If a router is impersonated on a network, traffic could be routed through the compromised system. |
| V-4113 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls how often TCP sends a keep-alive packet in attempting to verify that an idle connection is still intact. A higher value could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service with numerous connections. |
| V-4116 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the servers WINS resolution capability. |
| V-4438 | RegistryRule | Registry | In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a continuous stream of SYN packets to a server, and the server leaves the half-open connections open until it is overwhelmed and is no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. |
| V-4442 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing more than several seconds makes the computer vulnerable to a potential attack from someone walking up to the console to attempt to log on to the system before the lock takes effect. |
| V-4443 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths and sub-paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-4445 | RegistryRule | Registry | The POSIX subsystem is an Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard that defines a set of operating system services. The POSIX Subsystem is required if the server supports applications that use that subsystem. The subsystem introduces a security risk relating to processes that can potentially persist across logins. That is, if a user starts a process and then logs out, there is a potential that the next user who logs in to the system could access the previous users process. This is dangerous because the process started by the first user may retain that users system privileges, and anything the second user does with that process will be performed with the privileges of the first user. |
| V-4447 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing unsecure RPC communication exposes the system to man-in-the-middle attacks and data disclosure attacks. A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an intruder captures packets between a client and server and modifies them before allowing the packets to be exchanged. Usually the attacker will modify the information in the packets in an attempt to cause either the client or server to reveal sensitive information. |
| V-4448 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enabling this setting and then selecting the "Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed" option ensures that the policies will be reprocessed even if none have been changed. This way, any unauthorized changes are forced to match the domain-based group policy settings again. |
| V-6831 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted and signed. |
| V-6832 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will only communicate with an SMB server that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6833 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will only communicate with an SMB client that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6834 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |
| V-11806 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the username of the last logged on user provides half of the userid/password equation that an unauthorized person would need to gain access. The username of the last user to log on to a system must not be displayed. |
| V-14228 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from setting up a default system access control list for certain system objects, which could create a very large number of security events, filling the security log in Windows and making it difficult to identify actual issues. |
| V-14229 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from generating audit events for every file backed up or restored, which could fill the security log in Windows, making it difficult to identify actual issues. |
| V-14230 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting allows administrators to enable more precise auditing capabilities. |
| V-14232 | RegistryRule | Registry | IPSec exemption filters allow specific traffic that may be needed by the system for such things as Kerberos authentication. This setting configures Windows for specific IPSec exemptions. |
| V-14234 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the built-in Administrator account so that it runs in Admin Approval Mode. |
| V-14235 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the elevation requirements for logged on administrators to complete a task that requires raised privileges. |
| V-14236 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting controls the behavior of elevation when requested by a standard user account. |
| V-14237 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting requires Windows to respond to application installation requests by prompting for credentials. |
| V-14239 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures Windows to only allow applications installed in a secure location on the file system, such as the Program Files or the Windows\System32 folders, to run with elevated privileges. |
| V-14240 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting enables UAC. |
| V-14241 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting ensures that the elevation prompt is only used in secure desktop mode. |
| V-14242 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures non-UAC-compliant applications to run in virtualized file and registry entries in per-user locations, allowing them to run. |
| V-14243 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enumeration of administrator accounts when elevating can provide part of the logon information to an unauthorized user. This setting configures the system to always require users to enter in a username and password to elevate a running application. |
| V-14247 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Saving passwords in the Remote Desktop Client could allow an unauthorized user to establish a remote desktop session to another system. The system must be configured to prevent users from saving passwords in the Remote Desktop Client. |
| V-14249 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Preventing users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to Remote Session Hosts that they access helps reduce possible exposure of sensitive data. |
| V-14253 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Configuring RPC to restrict unauthenticated RPC clients from connecting to the RPC server will prevent anonymous connections. |
| V-14259 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Turning off this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system. This setting prevents the client computer from printing over HTTP, which allows the computer to print to printers on the intranet as well as the Internet. |
| V-14260 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Turning off this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system. This setting prevents the computer from downloading print driver packages over HTTP. |
| V-14261 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Turning off this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system. This setting prevents Windows from searching Windows Update for device drivers when no local drivers for a device are present. |
| V-14268 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Preserving zone of origin (internet, intranet, local, restricted) information on file attachments allows Windows to determine risk. |
| V-14269 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Preserving zone of origin (internet, intranet, local, restricted) information on file attachments allows Windows to determine risk. This setting prevents users from manually removing zone information from saved file attachments. |
| V-14270 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Attaching malicious files is a known avenue of attack. This setting configures the system to notify antivirus programs when a user opens a file attachment. |
| V-15666 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Peer-to-Peer applications can allow unauthorized access to a system and exposure of sensitive data. This setting will turn off the Microsoft Peer-to-Peer Networking Service. |
| V-15667 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | A Network Bridge can connect two or more network segments, allowing unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data. This setting prevents a Network Bridge from being installed and configured. |
| V-15672 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | ewing events is a function of administrators, who must not access the internet with privileged accounts. This setting will disable Events.asp hyperlinks in Event Viewer to prevent links to the internet from within events. |
| V-15674 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Turning off this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system. This setting prevents unhandled file associations from using the Microsoft Web service to find an application. |
| V-15682 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Attachments from RSS feeds may not be secure. This setting will prevent attachments from being downloaded from RSS feeds. |
| V-15683 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The shell protocol will limit the set of folders applications can open when run in protected mode. Restricting files an application can open to a limited set of folders increases the security of Windows. |
| V-15684 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Users must be aware of attempted program installations. This setting ensures users are notified if a web-based program attempts to install software. |
| V-15685 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Installation options for applications are typically controlled by administrators. This setting prevents users from changing installation options that may bypass security features. |
| V-15686 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Uncontrolled system updates can introduce issues to a system. This setting will prevent users from applying vendor-signed updates (though they may be from a trusted source). |
| V-15687 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Turning off this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system. This setting prevents users from being presented with Privacy and Installation options on first use of Windows Media Player, which could enable some communication with the vendor. |

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-1097 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user logon. |
| V-1098 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. |
| V-1099 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-1104 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-1105 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-1107 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is 24 for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-1150 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least 3 of the 4 types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters), as well as preventing the inclusion of user names or parts of. |
| V-2372 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-6836 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |

| V-1073 | AuditSettingRule | AuditSetting | Systems at unsupported service packs or releases will not receive security updates for new vulnerabilities, which leave them subject to exploitation. Systems must be maintained at a service pack level supported by the vendor with new security updates. |
| V-1081 | AuditSettingRule | AuditSetting | The ability to set access permissions and auditing is critical to maintaining the security and proper access controls of a system. To support this, local volumes must be formatted using a file system that supports NTFS attributes. |
| V-6840 | AuditSettingRule | AuditSetting | Passwords that do not expire or are reused increase the exposure of a password with greater probability of being discovered or cracked. |
| V-7002 | AuditSettingRule | AuditSetting | The lack of password protection enables anyone to gain access to the information system, which opens a backdoor opportunity for intruders to compromise the system as well as other resources. Accounts on a system must require passwords. |

| V-1152 | PermissionRule | RegistryAccessEntry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require anonymous access to the registry. This must be limited to properly protect the system. |
| V-26070 | PermissionRule | RegistryAccessEntry | Permissions on the Winlogon registry key must only allow privileged accounts to change registry values. If standard users have these permissions, there is a potential for programs to run with elevated privileges when a privileged user logs on to the system. |
| V-32282 | PermissionRule | RegistryAccessEntry | Permissions on the Active Setup\Installed Components registry key must only allow privileged accounts to add or change registry values. If standard user accounts have these permissions, there is a potential for programs to run with elevated privileges when a privileged user logs on to the system. |
| V-36722 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. The Application event log may be susceptible to tampering if proper permissions are not applied. |
| V-36723 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. The Security event log may disclose sensitive information or be susceptible to tampering if proper permissions are not applied. |
| V-36724 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. The System event log may be susceptible to tampering if proper permissions are not applied. |
| V-40177.a | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-40177.b | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-40178 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-40179 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Changing the system's file and directory permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system and installed applications. The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377). |
| V-57721 | PermissionRule | NTFSAccessEntry | Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information. Operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order to make access decisions regarding the modification or deletion of audit tools. |
| V-1075 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the shutdown button may allow individuals to shut down a system anonymously. Only authenticated users should be allowed to shut down the system. Preventing display of this button in the logon dialog box ensures that individuals who shut down the system are authorized and tracked in the system's Security event log. |
| V-1089 | RegistryRule | Registry | Failure to display the logon banner prior to a logon attempt will negate legal proceedings resulting from unauthorized access to system resources. |
| V-1090 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default Windows configuration caches the last logon credentials for users who log on interactively to a system. This feature is provided for system availability reasons, such as the user's machine being disconnected from the network or domain controllers being unavailable. Even though the credential cache is well-protected, if a system is attacked, an unauthorized individual may isolate the password to a domain user account using a password-cracking program and gain access to the domain. |
| V-1093 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-1136 | RegistryRule | Registry | Users must not be permitted to remain logged on to the network after they have exceeded their permitted logon hours. In many cases, this indicates that a user forgot to log off before leaving for the day. However, it may also indicate that a user is attempting unauthorized access at a time when the system may be less closely monitored. Forcibly disconnecting users when logon hours expire protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-1141 | RegistryRule | Registry | Some non-Microsoft SMB servers only support unencrypted (plain text) password authentication. Sending plain text passwords across the network, when authenticating to an SMB server, reduces the overall security of the environment. Check with the vendor of the SMB server to see if there is a way to support encrypted password authentication. |
| V-1145 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing a system to automatically log on when the machine is booted could give access to any unauthorized individual who restarts the computer. Automatic logon with administrator privileges would give full access to an unauthorized individual. |
| V-1151 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing users to install drivers can introduce malware or cause the instability of a system. Print driver installation should be restricted to administrators. |
| V-1153 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to stand-alone computers that are running later versions. |
| V-1154 | RegistryRule | Registry | abling the Ctrl+Alt+Del security attention sequence can compromise system security. Because only Windows responds to the Ctrl+Alt+Del security sequence, a user can be assured that any passwords entered following that sequence are sent only to Windows. If the sequence requirement is eliminated, malicious programs can request and receive a user's Windows password. Disabling this sequence also suppresses a custom logon banner. |
| V-1157 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and must be locked. Configuring a system to lock when a smart card is removed will ensure the system is inaccessible when unattended. |
| V-1162 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. |
| V-1163 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted. |
| V-1164 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but the channel is not integrity checked. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be signed. |
| V-1165 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. Disabling automatic password changes can make the system more vulnerable to malicious access. Frequent password changes can be a significant safeguard for your system. A new password for the computer account will be generated every 30 days. |
| V-1166 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will request packet signing when communicating with an SMB server that is enabled or required to perform SMB packet signing. |
| V-1171 | RegistryRule | Registry | Removable hard drives, if they are not properly configured, can be formatted and ejected by users who are not members of the Administrators Group. Formatting and ejecting removable NTFS media must only be done by administrators. |
| V-1172 | RegistryRule | Registry | Creating strong passwords that can be remembered by users requires some thought. By giving the user advance warning, the user has time to construct a sufficiently strong password. This setting configures the system to display a warning to users telling them how many days are left before their password expires. |
| V-1173 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions. If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing nonadministrative users to read shared objects, but not modify shared objects that they did not create. |
| V-1174 | RegistryRule | Registry | Open sessions can increase the avenues of attack on a system. This setting is used to control when a computer disconnects an inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished. This protects critical and sensitive network data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-2374 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing Autoplay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system. Autoplay begins reading from a drive as soon media is inserted into the drive. As a result, the setup file of programs or music on audio media may start. By default, Autoplay is disabled on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive) and on network drives. Enabling this policy disables Autoplay on all drives. |
| V-3338 | RegistryRule | Registry | Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously provide the potential for gaining unauthorized system access. Pipes are internal system communications processes. They are identified internally by ID numbers that vary between systems. To make access to these processes easier, these pipes are given names that do not vary between systems. This setting controls which of these pipes anonymous users may access. |
| V-3339 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-3340 | RegistryRule | Registry | Anonymous access to network shares provides the potential for gaining unauthorized system access by network users. This could lead to the exposure or corruption of sensitive data. |
| V-3343 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Solicited assistance is help that is specifically requested by the local user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3344 | RegistryRule | Registry | An account without a password can allow unauthorized access to a system as only the username would be required. Password policies should prevent accounts with blank passwords from existing on a system. However, if a local account with a blank password did exist, enabling this setting will prevent network access, limiting the account to local console logon only. |
| V-3373 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. This setting controls the maximum password age that a machine account may have. This setting must be set to no more than 30 days, ensuring the machine changes its password monthly. |
| V-3374 | RegistryRule | Registry | A computer connecting to a domain controller will establish a secure channel. Requiring strong session keys enforces 128-bit encryption between systems. |
| V-3377 | RegistryRule | Registry | Access by anonymous users must be restricted. If this setting is enabled, then anonymous users have the same rights and permissions as the built-in Everyone group. Anonymous users must not have these permissions or rights. |
| V-3378 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows includes two network-sharing security models - Classic and Guest only. With the Classic model, local accounts must be password protected; otherwise, anyone can use guest user accounts to access shared system resources. |
| V-3379 | RegistryRule | Registry | The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether or not a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-3381 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the signing requirements for LDAP clients. This setting must be set to Negotiate signing or Require signing, depending on the environment and type of LDAP server in use. |
| V-3382 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-3383 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting ensures that the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing. FIPS-compliant algorithms meet specific standards established by the U.S. Government and must be the algorithms used for all OS encryption functions. |
| V-3385 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the behavior of non-Windows subsystems when dealing with the case of arguments or commands. Case sensitivity could lead to the access of files or commands that must be restricted. To prevent this from happening, case insensitivity restrictions must be required. |
| V-3449 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing multiple Remote Desktop Services sessions could consume resources. There is also potential to make a secondary connection to a system with compromised credentials. |
| V-3453 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | This setting controls the ability of users to supply passwords automatically as part of their remote desktop connection. Disabling this setting would allow anyone to use the stored credentials in a connection item to connect to the terminal server. |
| V-3454 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote connections must be encrypted to prevent interception of data or sensitive information. Selecting "High Level" will ensure encryption of Remote Desktop Services sessions in both directions. |
| V-3455 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If a communal temporary folder is used for remote desktop sessions, it might be possible for users to access other users' temporary folders. If this setting is enabled, only one temporary folder is used for all remote desktop sessions. Per session temporary folders must be established. |
| V-3456 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote desktop session temporary folders must always be deleted after a session is over to prevent hard disk clutter and potential leakage of information. This setting controls the deletion of the temporary folders when the session is terminated. |
| V-3469 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | If this setting is enabled, then Group Policy settings are not refreshed while a user is currently logged on. This could lead to instances when a user does not have the latest changes to a policy applied and is therefore operating in an insecure context. |
| V-3470 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Remote assistance allows another user to view or take control of the local session of a user. Unsolicited remote assistance is help that is offered by the remote user. This may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. |
| V-3479 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default search behavior, when an application calls a function in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), is to search the current directory, followed by the directories contained in the system's path environment variable. An unauthorized DLL, inserted into an application's working directory, could allow malicious code to be run on the system. Setting this policy value forces the system to search the %Systemroot% for the DLL before searching the current directory or the rest of the path. |
| V-3480 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Uncontrolled system updates can introduce issues to a system. The automatic check for updates performed by Windows Media Player must be disabled to ensure a constant platform and to prevent the introduction of unknown\untested software on the system. |
| V-3481 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | The Windows Media Player uses software components, referred to as Codecs, to play back media files. By default, when an unknown file type is opened with the Media Player, it will search the Internet for the appropriate Codec and automatically download it. To ensure platform consistency and to protect against new vulnerabilities associated with media types, all Codecs must be installed by the System Administrator. |
| V-3666 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with RPC sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-4108 | RegistryRule | Registry | When the audit log reaches a given percent full, an audit event is written to the security log. It is recorded as a successful audit event under the category of System. This option may be especially useful if the audit logs are set to be cleared manually. |
| V-4110 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to disable IP source routing protects against spoofing. |
| V-4111 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing ICMP redirect of routes can lead to traffic not being routed properly. When disabled, this forces ICMP to be routed via shortest path first. |
| V-4112 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) is used to detect and configure default gateway addresses on the computer. If a router is impersonated on a network, traffic could be routed through the compromised system. |
| V-4113 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls how often TCP sends a keep-alive packet in attempting to verify that an idle connection is still intact. A higher value could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service with numerous connections. |
| V-4116 | RegistryRule | Registry | Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the servers WINS resolution capability. |
| V-4438 | RegistryRule | Registry | In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a continuous stream of SYN packets to a server, and the server leaves the half-open connections open until it is overwhelmed and is no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. |
| V-4442 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing more than several seconds makes the computer vulnerable to a potential attack from someone walking up to the console to attempt to log on to the system before the lock takes effect. |
| V-4443 | RegistryRule | Registry | The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system. Some processes may require remote access to the registry. This setting controls which registry paths and sub-paths are accessible from a remote computer. These registry paths must be limited, as they could give unauthorized individuals access to the registry. |
| V-4445 | RegistryRule | Registry | The POSIX subsystem is an Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard that defines a set of operating system services. The POSIX Subsystem is required if the server supports applications that use that subsystem. The subsystem introduces a security risk relating to processes that can potentially persist across logins. That is, if a user starts a process and then logs out, there is a potential that the next user who logs in to the system could access the previous users process. This is dangerous because the process started by the first user may retain that users system privileges, and anything the second user does with that process will be performed with the privileges of the first user. |
| V-4447 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Allowing unsecure RPC communication exposes the system to man-in-the-middle attacks and data disclosure attacks. A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an intruder captures packets between a client and server and modifies them before allowing the packets to be exchanged. Usually the attacker will modify the information in the packets in an attempt to cause either the client or server to reveal sensitive information. |
| V-4448 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Enabling this setting and then selecting the "Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed" option ensures that the policies will be reprocessed even if none have been changed. This way, any unauthorized changes are forced to match the domain-based group policy settings again. |
| V-6831 | RegistryRule | Registry | Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted. If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be encrypted and signed. |
| V-6832 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB client will only communicate with an SMB server that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6833 | RegistryRule | Registry | The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for many network operations. Digitally signed SMB packets aid in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. If this policy is enabled, the SMB server will only communicate with an SMB client that performs SMB packet signing. |
| V-6834 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |
| V-11806 | RegistryRule | Registry | playing the username of the last logged on user provides half of the userid/password equation that an unauthorized person would need to gain access. The username of the last user to log on to a system must not be displayed. |
| V-14228 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from setting up a default system access control list for certain system objects, which could create a very large number of security events, filling the security log in Windows and making it difficult to identify actual issues. |
| V-14229 | RegistryRule | Registry | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks.

**Description:** This Security Technical Implementation Guide is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. The requirements are derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 and related documents. Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via email to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-73359 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This policy setting determines whether the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) validates every request for a session ticket against the user rights policy of the target computer. The policy is enabled by default, which is the most secure setting for validating that access to target resources is not circumvented. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73361 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum amount of time (in minutes) that a granted session ticket can be used to access a particular service. Session tickets are used only to authenticate new connections with servers. Ongoing operations are not interrupted if the session ticket used to authenticate the connection expires during the connection. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73363 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | In Kerberos, there are two types of tickets: Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and Service Tickets. Kerberos tickets have a limited lifetime so the time an attacker has to implement an attack is limited. This policy controls how long TGTs can be renewed. With Kerberos, the user's initial authentication to the domain controller results in a TGT, which is then used to request Service Tickets to resources. Upon startup, each computer gets a TGT before requesting a service ticket to the domain controller and any other computers it needs to access. For services that start up under a specified user account, users must always get a TGT first and then get Service Tickets to all computers and services accessed. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73365 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user's Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) may be renewed. This security configuration limits the amount of time an attacker has to crack the TGT and gain access. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73367 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum time difference (in minutes) that Kerberos will tolerate between the time on a client's clock and the time on a server's clock while still considering the two clocks synchronous. In order to prevent replay attacks, Kerberos uses timestamps as part of its protocol definition. For timestamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the server need to be in sync as much as possible. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73309 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-73311 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack while allowing for honest errors made during normal user logon. |
| V-73313 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128 |
| V-73315 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is "24" for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-73317 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-73319 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-73321 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-73323 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least three of the four types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters) and prevents the inclusion of user names or parts of user names.

| V-73699 | RegistryRule | Registry | If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure. The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information. If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user. Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys. |
| V-73701 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting ensures the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing.

Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via email to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-73359 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This policy setting determines whether the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) validates every request for a session ticket against the user rights policy of the target computer. The policy is enabled by default, which is the most secure setting for validating that access to target resources is not circumvented. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73361 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum amount of time (in minutes) that a granted session ticket can be used to access a particular service. Session tickets are used only to authenticate new connections with servers. Ongoing operations are not interrupted if the session ticket used to authenticate the connection expires during the connection. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73363 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | In Kerberos, there are two types of tickets: Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and Service Tickets. Kerberos tickets have a limited lifetime so the time an attacker has to implement an attack is limited. This policy controls how long TGTs can be renewed. With Kerberos, the user's initial authentication to the domain controller results in a TGT, which is then used to request Service Tickets to resources. Upon startup, each computer gets a TGT before requesting a service ticket to the domain controller and any other computers it needs to access. For services that start up under a specified user account, users must always get a TGT first and then get Service Tickets to all computers and services accessed. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73365 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user's Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) may be renewed. This security configuration limits the amount of time an attacker has to crack the TGT and gain access. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73367 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum time difference (in minutes) that Kerberos will tolerate between the time on a client's clock and the time on a server's clock while still considering the two clocks synchronous. In order to prevent replay attacks, Kerberos uses timestamps as part of its protocol definition. For timestamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the server need to be in sync as much as possible. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-73309 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-73311 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack while allowing for honest errors made during normal user logon. |
| V-73313 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128 |
| V-73315 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is "24" for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-73317 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-73319 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-73321 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-73323 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least three of the four types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters) and prevents the inclusion of user names or parts of user names. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000069-GPOS-00037, SRG-OS-000070-GPOS-00038, SRG-OS-000071-GPOS-00039, SRG-OS-000266-GPOS-00101 |
| V-73325 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords, which are easily compromised. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-73413 | AuditPolicyRule | AuditPolicySubcategory | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-73309 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-73311 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack while allowing for honest errors made during normal user logon. |
| V-73313 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128 |
| V-73315 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is "24" for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-73317 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-73319 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-73321 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-73323 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least three of the four types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters) and prevents the inclusion of user names or parts of user names. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000069-GPOS-00037, SRG-OS-000070-GPOS-00038, SRG-OS-000071-GPOS-00039, SRG-OS-000266-GPOS-00101 |
| V-73325 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords, which are easily compromised. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-73413 | AuditPolicyRule | AuditPolicySubcategory | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-73309 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-73311 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack while allowing for honest errors made during normal user logon. |
| V-73313 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128 |
| V-73315 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is "24" for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-73317 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-73319 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-73321 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-73323 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least three of the four types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters) and prevents the inclusion of user names or parts of user names. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000069-GPOS-00037, SRG-OS-000070-GPOS-00038, SRG-OS-000071-GPOS-00039, SRG-OS-000266-GPOS-00101 |
| V-73325 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords, which are easily compromised. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |

| V-73579 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Basic authentication uses plain-text passwords that could be used to compromise a system. Disabling Basic authentication will reduce this potential. |
| V-73581 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Indexing of encrypted files may expose sensitive data. This setting prevents encrypted files from being indexed. |
| V-73583 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Installation options for applications are typically controlled by administrators. This setting prevents users from changing installation options that may bypass security features. |
| V-73585 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Standard user accounts must not be granted elevated privileges. Enabling Windows Installer to elevate privileges when installing applications can allow malicious persons and applications to gain full control of a system. |
| V-73587 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Web-based programs may attempt to install malicious software on a system. Ensuring users are notified if a web-based program attempts to install software allows them to refuse the installation. |
| V-73589 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Windows can be configured to automatically sign the user back in after a Windows Update restart. Some protections are in place to help ensure this is done in a secure fashion; however, disabling this will prevent the caching of credentials for this purpose and also ensure the user is aware of the restart. |
| V-73591 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. Enabling PowerShell script block logging will record detailed information from the processing of PowerShell commands and scripts. This can provide additional detail when malware has run on a system. |

If this policy is enabled, outgoing secure channel traffic will be signed. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187, SRG-OS-000424-GPOS-00188 |
| V-73639 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. Disabling automatic password changes can make the system more vulnerable to malicious access. Frequent password changes can be a significant safeguard for the system. A new password for the computer account will be generated every 30 days. |
| V-73641 | RegistryRule | Registry | Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. This setting controls the maximum password age that a machine account may have. This must be set to no more than 30 days, ensuring the machine changes its password monthly. |
| V-73643 | RegistryRule | Registry | A computer connecting to a domain controller will establish a secure channel. The secure channel connection may be subject to compromise, such as hijacking or eavesdropping, if strong session keys are not used to establish the connection. Requiring strong session keys enforces 128-bit encryption between systems. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187, SRG-OS-000424-GPOS-00188 |
| V-73645 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and should be locked when unattended. The screen saver should be set at a maximum of 15 minutes and be password protected. This protects critical and sensitive data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer. |
| V-73647 | RegistryRule | Registry | Failure to display the logon banner prior to a logon attempt will negate legal proceedings resulting from unauthorized access to system resources. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000023-GPOS-00006, SRG-OS-000024-GPOS-00007, SRG-OS-000228-GPOS-00088 |

| V-73667 | RegistryRule | Registry | Anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts allows anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all accounts names, thus providing a list of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-73669 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-73673 | RegistryRule | Registry | Access by anonymous users must be restricted. If this setting is enabled, anonymous users have the same rights and permissions as the built-in Everyone group. Anonymous users must not have these permissions or rights. |
| V-73675 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |
| V-73677 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Windows Security Account Manager (SAM) stores users' passwords. Restricting Remote Procedure Call (RPC) connections to the SAM to Administrators helps protect those credentials. |
| V-73679 | RegistryRule | Registry | Services using Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM authentication may gain unauthorized access if allowed to authenticate anonymously versus using the computer identity. |
| V-73681 | RegistryRule | Registry | NTLM sessions that are allowed to fall back to Null (unauthenticated) sessions may gain unauthorized access. |
| V-73683 | RegistryRule | Registry | PKU2U is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol. This setting prevents online identities from authenticating to domain-joined systems. Authentication will be centrally managed with Windows user accounts. |
| V-73685 | RegistryRule | Registry | Certain encryption types are no longer considered secure. The DES and RC4 encryption suites must not be used for Kerberos encryption. Note: Organizations with domain controllers running earlier versions of Windows where RC4 encryption is enabled, selecting "The other domain supports Kerberos AES Encryption" on domain trusts, may be required to allow client communication across the trust relationship. |
| V-73687 | RegistryRule | Registry | The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-73691 | RegistryRule | Registry | The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to standalone computers that are running later versions. |
| V-73693 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting controls the signing requirements for LDAP clients. This must be set to "Negotiate signing" or "Require signing", depending on the environment and type of LDAP server in use. |
| V-73695 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with Remote Procedure Call (RPC) sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-73697 | RegistryRule | Registry | Microsoft has implemented a variety of security support providers for use with Remote Procedure Call (RPC) sessions. All of the options must be enabled to ensure the maximum security level. |
| V-73699 | RegistryRule | Registry | If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure. The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information. If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user. Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys. |
| V-73701 | RegistryRule | Registry | This setting ensures the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing. FIPS-compliant algorithms meet specific standards established by the U.S. Government and must be the algorithms used for all OS encryption functions. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000033-GPOS-00014, SRG-OS-000478-GPOS-00223 |
| V-73705 | RegistryRule | Registry | Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. Each type of object is created with a default Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions. When this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing non-administrative users to read shared objects but not to modify shared objects they did not create. |
| V-73707 | RegistryRule | Registry | User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the built-in Administrator account so that it runs in Admin Approval Mode. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00157, SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00156 |

| V-93443 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This policy setting determines whether the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) validates every request for a session ticket against the user rights policy of the target computer. The policy is enabled by default, which is the most secure setting for validating that access to target resources is not circumvented. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-93445 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum amount of time (in minutes) that a granted session ticket can be used to access a particular service. Session tickets are used only to authenticate new connections with servers. Ongoing operations are not interrupted if the session ticket used to authenticate the connection expires during the connection. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-93447 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | In Kerberos, there are two types of tickets: Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and Service Tickets. Kerberos tickets have a limited lifetime so the time an attacker has to implement an attack is limited. This policy controls how long TGTs can be renewed. With Kerberos, the user's initial authentication to the domain controller results in a TGT, which is then used to request Service Tickets to resources. Upon startup, each computer gets a TGT before requesting a service ticket to the domain controller and any other computers it needs to access. For services that start up under a specified user account, users must always get a TGT first and then get Service Tickets to all computers and services accessed. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-93449 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user's Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) may be renewed. This security configuration limits the amount of time an attacker has to crack the TGT and gain access. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-93451 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | This setting determines the maximum time difference (in minutes) that Kerberos will tolerate between the time on a client's clock and the time on a server's clock while still considering the two clocks synchronous. In order to prevent replay attacks, Kerberos uses timestamps as part of its protocol definition. For timestamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the server need to be in sync as much as possible. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058 |
| V-93141 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack while allowing for honest errors made during normal user logon. |
| V-93143 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128 |
| V-93145 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-93459 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least three of the four types of characters (numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters) and prevents the inclusion of user names or parts of user names. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000069-GPOS-00037, SRG-OS-000070-GPOS-00038, SRG-OS-000071-GPOS-00039, SRG-OS-000266-GPOS-00101 |
| V-93463 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-93465 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords, which are easily compromised. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-93471 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-93477 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-93479 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is "24" for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |

This setting controls whether a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-93469 | RegistryRule | Registry | Some non-Microsoft SMB servers only support unencrypted (plain-text) password authentication. Sending plain-text passwords across the network when authenticating to an SMB server reduces the overall security of the environment. Check with the vendor of the SMB server to determine if there is a way to support encrypted password authentication. |
| V-93493 | RegistryRule | Registry | If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure. The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information. If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user. Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys. |
| V-93495 | RegistryRule | Registry | Certain encryption types are no longer considered secure. The DES and RC4 encryption suites must not be used for Kerberos encryption. Note: Organizations with domain controllers running earlier versions of Windows where RC4 encryption is enabled, selecting "The other domain supports Kerberos AES Encryption" on domain trusts, may be required to allow client communication across the trust relationship. |

| V-93533 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Preventing users from sharing the local drives on their client computers with Remote Session Hosts that they access helps reduce possible exposure of sensitive data. |
| V-93537 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous logon users (null session connections) to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system. |
| V-93539 | RegistryRule | Registry | Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements. |
| V-93541 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the server's WINS resolution capability. |
| V-93545 | RegistryRule | Registry | Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an intruder captures packets between the server and the client and modifies them before forwarding them to the client. In the case of an LDAP server, this means that an attacker could cause a client to make decisions based on false records from the LDAP directory. The risk of an attacker pulling this off can be decreased by implementing strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Furthermore, implementing Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.

**Description:** This Security Technical Implementation Guide is published as a tool to improve the security of Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. The requirements are derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 and related documents. Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via email to the following address: disa.stig_spt@mail.mil.

| RuleId | RuleType | DSC Resource | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| V-93141 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack while allowing for honest errors made during normal user logon. |
| V-93143 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to "0". The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128 |
| V-93145 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts. |
| V-93459 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least three of the four types of characters (numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters) and prevents the inclusion of user names or parts of user names. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000069-GPOS-00037, SRG-OS-000070-GPOS-00038, SRG-OS-000071-GPOS-00039, SRG-OS-000266-GPOS-00101 |
| V-93463 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network. |
| V-93465 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords, which are easily compromised. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled. |
| V-93471 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. |
| V-93477 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system. |
| V-93479 | AccountPolicyRule | AccountPolicy | A system is more vulnerable to unauthorized access when system users recycle the same password several times without being required to change to a unique password on a regularly scheduled basis. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes. The default value is "24" for Windows domain systems. DoD has decided this is the appropriate value for all Windows systems. |
| V-92967 | AuditPolicyRule | AuditPolicySubcategory | Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. Logon records user logons. If this is an interactive logon, it is recorded on the local system. If it is to a network share, it is recorded on the system accessed.

| V-93269 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Windows can be configured to automatically sign the user back in after a Windows Update restart. Some protections are in place to help ensure this is done in a secure fashion; however, disabling this will prevent the caching of credentials for this purpose and also ensure the user is aware of the restart. |
| V-93275 | RegistryRule | Registry | The default Windows configuration caches the last logon credentials for users who log on interactively to a system. This feature is provided for system availability reasons, such as the user's machine being disconnected from the network or domain controllers being unavailable. Even though the credential cache is well protected, if a system is attacked, an unauthorized individual may isolate the password to a domain user account using a password-cracking program and gain access to the domain. |
| V-93277 | RegistryRule | RegistryPolicyFile | Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to protect data that could be used in credential theft attacks if compromised. This authentication information, which was stored in the Local Security Authority (LSA) in previous versions of Windows, is isolated from the rest of operating system and can only be accessed by privileged system software. |
| V-93279 | RegistryRule | Registry | An account without a password can allow unauthorized access to a system as only the username would be required. Password policies should prevent accounts with blank passwords from existing on a system. However, if a local account with a blank password does exist, enabling this setting will prevent network access, limiting the account to local console logon only. |

This setting controls whether a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed. |
| V-93469 | RegistryRule | Registry | Some non-Microsoft SMB servers only support unencrypted (plain-text) password authentication. Sending plain-text passwords across the network when authenticating to an SMB server reduces the overall security of the environment. Check with the vendor of the SMB server to determine if there is a way to support encrypted password authentication. |
| V-93493 | RegistryRule | Registry | If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure. The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information. If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user. Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys. |
| V-93495 | RegistryRule | Registry | Certain encryption types are no longer considered secure. The DES and RC4 encryption suites must not be used for Kerberos encryption. Note: Organizations with domain controllers running earlier versions of Windows where RC4 encryption is enabled, selecting "The other domain supports Kerberos AES Encryption" on domain trusts, may be required to allow client communication across the trust relationship. |
